<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The author of this work modestly trusts that all
who read it with care will admit that in it he has distinctly
shown that mending or repairing, which has
hitherto been regarded as a mere adjunct to other
arts, is really an art by itself, if not a science, since it
is based on chemical and other principles, which
admit of extensive application and general combination.
It has its <i>laws</i>&mdash;a fact which has never been
hinted at by any writer, since all recipes for restoration
in existence are each singly inventions made to
suit certain cases. This work has been conceived on
a different principle.</p>

<p>A thorough knowledge of this art of repairing,
mending, or restoring various objects is of very great
value, since there is no household in which it is not
often called into requisition. In the kitchen or drawing-room,
in the library and nursery, there are daily
breakages, of which a large and needless proportion
are losses, simply because such a man as a general
mender, who is accomplished in <i>all</i> branches of the
art, does not exist. And, what is more, it is equally
true that no one has ever realised to what a vast extent
mending and saving may be carried, with a little
expenditure of time, practice, and money, by any intelligent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
person who will devote serious attention to
it. Within a comparatively few years discoveries in
science or in nature have enlarged the ability of the
mender to an extraordinary extent&mdash;I need only mention
the applications now made with silicate of soda,
celluloid, gutta percha, and glycerine to confirm what
I say&mdash;so largely, indeed, that only the accomplished
technologist and chemist is really aware of what can
be done in general repairing compared to what was
possible only a few years ago. I believe that there
are few thoroughly practical persons (and, I may add,
few who take an interest in art in any form, or even
in books) who will read this work without deep interest,
and without acquiring information of such value
that in comparison to it the cost of the book will seem
a trifle.</p>

<p>Though mending or restoring is a subject which in
some form comes home to and concerns everybody,
and which it is assuredly everybody’s interest to
understand, this is, I believe, the first book in which
its application to a <i>great</i> variety of wants has been
made, and that in such a clearly co-ordinated manner,
and according to such a simple principle, that
whoever reads it can have no difficulty in mending
any object, even though it be not described here. In
all works of the kind which I have seen the recipes
for repairing have been given simply according to
their <i>subjects</i>, without any view to general principles
of application, and a great proportion of these
were in turn simply copied from old books of miscellaneous
“receipts,” or newspapers in which every so-called
new discovery is announced as infallible, or as
if it had been tried and tested to perfection. That I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
have not recklessly accumulated in this fashion all
kinds of <i>recipes</i> to fill my pages will appear very
plainly to every chemist or technologist, who will perceive
that, proceeding from a comprehensive table of
generally recognised and long-tested bases of cements,
I have given deductions and combinations scientifically
agreeing with their laws and with experiment.
The true object of giving a great number of recipes
has not been solely or simply to supply the house-keeper
or mechanic with instructions for certain repairs,
but also to suggest to the technologist and inventor
new ideas and applications. Thus, when we
know that given proportions of zinc in powder, silicate
of soda, and chalk form a strong cement, resembling
zinc, it is as well to suggest that this may be varied
by employing other metals and substances, such as
bronze-powders and mineral oxides, to be always preceded
by a little experiment. I venture to say that
any intelligent person who masters this work can, on
this hint, make for himself innumerable inventions;
and I am sure that there is not the editor of a single
technological journal who will not testify to the fact
that every year a great many patents are taken out
and fortunes made from recipes which are neither so
scientifically combined nor practically useful as those
which I here give. That there are fortunes still to be
made is abundantly proved by the fact that there are
very few people, comparatively speaking, who know
where to get or how to make waterproof glue, or how
to mend with it, neatly and durably, shoes, umbrellas,
and many rents in garments; how to unite a
broken strap; mend, by felting, torn hats; rehabilitate
perfectly worm-eaten and torn-away paper; restore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
decayed broken wood; or mend, in fact, anything
except with common glue or mucilage&mdash;both of
which soon give way and crack or melt. So long as
such general ignorance prevails, just so long there
will be an opportunity for the inventor to make and
sell cements, and for the repairer to find employment.</p>

<p>I call special attention to the fact that this book contains
no merely traditional, untested recipes which
have been simply transferred from one Housekeeper’s
Manual to another for generations. Where I have
not been guided by my own personal experience&mdash;which
is, I venture to say, not very limited&mdash;I have
either followed truly scientific works, such as the
three hundred volumes of the Chemical-Technical
Library of <span class="smcap">A. Hartleben</span>; or, when citing from
older authors, have invariably given recipes which
agree with the principles advanced by modern analysts
and inventors. And though not a professor of
chemistry, yet, as I studied it and natural philosophy
in my youth under <span class="smcap">Leopold Gmelin</span>, <span class="smcap">L. Passelt</span>, and
Professor <span class="smcap">Joseph Henry</span>, I trust that I have been sufficiently
qualified to avoid errors in what I have written.
In short, that I have <i>not</i> recklessly accumulated
every recipe which I could find, and that what I give
are really trustworthy, will appear plainly to the
chemist or technologist, who will perceive that, proceeding
from a given table of generally recognised
and long-tested bases of cements, &amp;c., I have then
given deductions and combinations scientifically
agreeing with their laws and with experiment. My
book is not a <i>pièce de manufacture</i>, or of hack-work,
but one which is the result of many years of practical
experience in the minor arts and industries, on which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
subject alone I have published twenty-two works,
without including pamphlets, lectures, and at least
one hundred letters or articles in leading magazines
and newspapers. There is, in short, very little
mending or making described in this book which I
have not at one time or other personally effected, having
had all my life a passion for mending and restoring
all kinds of objects, and that scientifically and
thoroughly.</p>

<p>As I have observed, there is in every household
continual breakage of many kinds&mdash;“or of the rending
which cries for mending”&mdash;it is a matter of some
importance that some one in the family should pay
special attention to such matters. How often have I
seen very valuable objects stuck together&mdash;anyhow
and clumsily&mdash;with putty, wafers, sealing-wax, glue,
flour-paste, or anything which will “hold” for a time,
when a perfect cure might have just as well been
effected had the proper recipe been taken to the first
chemist. This is equally true as regards taking ink
or stains out of garments, or repairing the latter perfectly,
or mending shoes or indiarubber cloth, or
felting worn hats and many other articles, all of which
are treated of in this work.</p>

<p>It is true that everybody is not naturally ingenious,
or clever, or gifted, but all may become <i>skilful menders</i>
if they will duly consider the subject (which requires
no hard study) and experiment on it a little.
And here I would seriously address a few words to
all who are interested in education. There is a certain
faculty which may be called constructiveness,
which is nearly allied to invention, and which is a
marvellous developer in all children of quickness of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
perception, thought, or intellect. It is the art of
using the fingers to make or manipulate, in any way;
it exists in every human being, and it may be brought
out to an extraordinary degree in the young, as has
been fully tested and proved. Now, if we take two
children of the same age, sex, and capacity, both
going to the same school and pursuing the same
studies, and if one of the two devotes from two to
four hours a week to an industrial art class (<i>i.e.</i>,
studying simple original <i>design</i>, easy wood-carving,
repoussé, embroidery, &amp;c.), it will be found&mdash;as it has
been by very extensive experiment&mdash;that the latter
child will at the end of the year excel the former in
<i>all</i> branches of learning; that is to say, in arithmetic
or geography, so greatly does ingenuity proceed from
the fingers to the brain. Now, mending is so nearly
allied to all the minor or mechanical arts, it enters
into them so closely, that it in a manner belongs to
and is an introduction to them all. Like them, it
stimulates invention or ingenuity, and is perhaps of
far greater practical utility or direct use. Boys and
girls learn very willingly how to mend, and, from a
long experience in teaching them, I should say that a
class with experiments and practical instruction in
what is given in this book should take precedence of
all carpentry, metal-work, joining, leather-work, or
any other branches whatever. For it is <i>easier</i> than
any of them, and it is of far more general utility, as
the following pages clearly show. Such teaching
would cost next to nothing for outfit, and would be
the best introduction to technical education of all
kinds.</p>

<p>There is an immense amount of breakage in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
world, yet, as a French writer on the subject observes,
there are more great artists than good <i>menders</i>; the
latter being so extremely rare that proofs of it are
seen in bungling restorations in every museum in
Europe, and in the almost impossibility of finding
(out of Italy) men who can perfectly mend first-class
ceramic ware. We see this ignorance in reproductions
of delicate ivory ware coarsely cast in gypsum, and in
a vast rejection and destruction of antiquities in wood,
stone, or ceramic ware, simply because they are most
ignorantly supposed to be beyond repair when they
might, with <i>proper knowledge</i>, be very easily and cheaply
restored, to great profit. And if the reader will
visit the “dead rooms” of any museum in Europe
and then study this book, he will find ample confirmation
of what I say.</p>

<p>And here I would mention that every collector or
owner of any kind of works of art, of <i>bric-à-brac</i>, or
curiosities, who will master the art of mending, can
find an illimitable field for picking up bargains in
almost every shop of antiquities in Europe, especially
in the smaller or humbler kind. For it is very far
from being true that these dealers know “how to
mend everything;” on the contrary, I have often
found them very ignorant indeed of mending, and
have frequently instructed them in it. Thus I now
have before me a “Holy Family” of the early sixteenth
century, bas-relief in stamped leather, twelve
inches by eight, for which I paid two francs, but
which I might have had for one, it being utterly
dilapidated, and apparently of no value. In two or
three hours I restored it perfectly, and it would now
sell for perhaps a hundred francs. By it hangs a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
“Madonna and Child,” painted on a panel, gold
ground, fourteenth century, which, including a very
broad and remarkable old frame, I purchased both
for twelve francs. The panel was warped like a sabre,
<img src="images/i_xiv.jpg" alt="" />, the colour and <i>gesso</i> ground badly scaled
away in many places. It was split in two pieces; in
short, it appeared to be nearly worthless. Now it is
in very good condition, and would be an ornament to
any gallery. As regards repairing ceramic ware or
china, glass, and porcelain, art has of late years made
remarkable advances, this kind of mending being the
most in requisition. As for old carved wood, no
matter how badly broken it may be, eaten away by
worms, or rotten, or even wanting large pieces, so
long as its original form is evident, it can be <i>very
easily</i> repaired or restored to all its original beauty
and integrity, as I shall fully explain. In this alone
there is a vast field for investment or money-making,
because there are annually destroyed almost everywhere
quantities of old wood-carvings; for, being
badly worm-eaten, they are ignorantly supposed to
be irreparable. The same may be said of ancient
carved ivories, which are ready to drop at a touch
into dust, as were those from Nineveh in the British
Museum, yet which are now firm and clear. It is also
true of the bindings of old books, many of marvellous
beauty, whether of stamped leather, parchment, or
carved. Even more interesting and curious is the
repairing or restoring worm-eaten manuscripts or
papers of any kind, or parchment, the easy process
of filling the holes not being known to many bibliophiles.
This art is becoming known in Germany,
where it is not unusual to buy an old book for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
mark, rebind it in hard old parchment, repair it generally
for two or three, and then sell it, according to
the subject, for several hundred or thousand per cent.
profit.</p>

<p>It is greatly to be regretted that it is so little
known, especially in England, that to repair a few
holes or restore a little broken, crumbling carving it
is not absolutely necessary to tear down an entire
Gothic church and build a new one, as is so very generally
the case. There is no stone-work, however
dilapidated it may be, which cannot be mended very
perfectly, and that in almost all cases with a material
which sets even harder than the original, as was perfectly
shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Dilapidated
stone carved work, of all ages and kinds, which
could be perfectly restored to a degree which even
very few artists suspect, abounds in Italy, where it
can be purchased for a song. The song, it is true, is
generally sung to a small silver accompaniment, but
the purchaser may make it golden for himself. For
very few know how to restore a knocked-off nose so
that the line of juncture be not visible; yet even this
is possible, as I shall show. And I may here remark
that in all the first galleries and museums of Europe,
without one exception, there is abundant evidence to
prove that, of all the arts, the one of repairing and
restoring is the one least understood and most strangely
neglected.</p>

<p>There is hardly a village so small that one man or
woman could not make in it or eke out a living by repairing
different objects. In towns and cities the demand
for such work is much greater, for there ladies
break expensive fans and jewellery, and children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
their dolls and toys, for mending of which the “rehabilitators”
require “much moneys,” especially in
the United States, where prices for anything out of
the way are appalling.</p>

<p>I would therefore beg all people who are gifted
with some small allowance of “ingenuity,” tact, art,
or common-sense to consider that Mending or Restoring
is a calling very easily learned by a little practice,
and one by which a living can be made, even in its
humblest branches, as is shown by the umbrella-menders
and chair-caners in the streets. But common-sense
teaches that any one who shall have mastered
all that is explicitly set forth in this book ought
certainly to be able to gain money, even largely; for,
as I said, the opportunities of purchasing dilapidated
works of art, mending and selling them, are innumerable,
and Restoration is as yet everywhere in its
mere rudiments and very little practised. That which
might be a very great general industry of vast utility,
employing many thousands now idle, only exists in a
hap-hazard, casual way, as dependent on other kinds
of work. But to me it appears as a great art by itself,
dependent on certain principles of general application.
And when we consider what is generally
wasted for want of proper knowledge of this great
art, it seems to me to be but rational that if we had
in London a school for teaching mending and restoring
in all its branches as a trade, with a museum to
show the public, probably to its great astonishment,
what marvels can be wrought by renewing what is
old, it would be of great service to the country at
large. A very little reflection will convince the least
visionary or most practical reader that what is wasted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
or annually destroyed of valuable old works, which
cannot be replaced, because they are no longer manufactured,
if restored, would form the basis of a great
national industry. It has not as yet, however, entered
into the head of any one to conceive this, simply
because no one has ever been educated as a general
restorer, but only in a secondary, supplementary,
small way as a specialist, generally as a botcher.
And I maintain, from no inconsiderable knowledge
of the subject, that the best menders and restorers
by far are those who understand the most branches
of their calling. The reason for this is plain; it is
because a repairer, when he comes to some unforeseen
difficulty&mdash;for example, in mending china&mdash;and
finds the cements used are not exactly applicable, he
will, if sensible, think of some other adhesive used in
other kinds of work, or other combinations or appliances.</p>

<p>I go so far as to say that an exhibition of specimens
showing all that can be done in mending and restoration
in ceramic art, leather, carved stone, books,
carved and wrought wood, castings, metal, furniture,
fans, and toys, would probably serve as sufficient beginning
to establish classes and a school. The objects
should, when possible, be accompanied by a
duplicate or photograph showing the condition they
were in before restoration, on the principle of the
picture-cleaners, who amaze the public with such
startling contrasts of dirt and splendour.</p>

<p>How this can all be done will be found in this book,
which I venture to suggest will often be found useful
in every family, or wherever “things” are broken
and worn. For the collector of curiosities who would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
willingly pick up bargains, I seriously and earnestly
commend it as a <i>vade mecum</i> by means of which he
may literally make money in any shop. For, as I
have already said, strange as it may seem, the small
dealers in <i>bric-à-brac</i> are generally very ignorant of
all the curious secrets of restoration, or else they have
no time or means to attend to such work. Again, if
the collector has learned what I here teach, he will
often detect restoration allied to forgery in expensive
antiques, guaranteed to be perfect. It has been well
observed by M. <span class="smcap">Ris-Paquot</span>, in his valuable work,
<i>L’Art de restaurer soi-même les Faïences et Porcelaines</i>,
that it often happens, most unfortunately, that precious
relics whose value is immense, such as the Italian
<i>faïences</i> and those of Palissy or Henri II., come to
collections in such a condition, so pitifully injured,
that <i>de visu</i> we cannot buy them because we know of
nobody who can actually restore them, and because
this delicate work requires so much special knowledge.
Add to this, that their great value and rarity
disincline us to trust to the first-comer, or general
workman, treasures which he might utterly ruin by
clumsiness or ignorance.</p>

<p>I may add that I seldom walk out in Florence without
seeing old worn <i>faïences</i> for sale for a mere trifle
which with a little retouching, gilding, and firing
could be made quite valuable. In such instances
there need be no complaint of destroying the venerable
effect and value of antiquity. In them antique
material may be legitimately employed as a
basis for newer work, especially when it is broken
away, worn down to the core, or full of holes. Now,
with what this book teaches in his mind, the artist or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
tourist will very soon realise, if he be at all ingenious,
or can avail himself of the aid of some friend
who has even a very slight knowledge of art, that he
can at a slight outlay purchase objects which will become
very valuable when afterwards restored at
home.</p>

<p>As I can imagine no head of a family, and no dealer
in miscellaneous works of art or any small wares, no
provider of furniture or furnisher, to whom this work
will not be a most acceptable gift, so I am very confident
that every traveller who has trunks to mend or
broken straps to join, and every emigrant roughing
it in the forests or the bush of Australia or Canada,
may learn from it many useful devices, and the fact
that with nothing more than a small tin of liquid
glue and another of indiarubber he can effect more
than could be imagined by any one who has not
studied the subject. On this I speak not without
experience, having found that, both as a soldier and
a traveller in the Wild West of America, my knowledge
of mending was of great use to my friends as
well as myself. A perusal of the Index of what is
here given will satisfy the reader that this manual is
in fact a <i>vade mecum</i> for almost all sorts and conditions
of men and women, and that there are none
who would not be thankful for it.</p>

<p>A friend adds to these remarks the suggestion that
this work may properly be included among the presents
to a bride as an aid to housekeeping; and it will
probably be admitted that it would prove quite as
useful as many of the gifts which are usually bestowed
on such occasions.</p>

<p>I have truly said that, while breaking and decay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
are universal, there are literally nowhere any generally
accomplished repairers&mdash;that is to say, experts
who know and can practise even what is set forth in
this book. Certain menders of broken china there
are, of whom the great authority on fictile restoration,
<span class="smcap">Ris-Pasquot</span>, declares that none can be trusted
with anything valuable. There are so few needle-women
who can sew up a rent perfectly that a lady
“to the manor born” paid in Rome <i>two pounds</i>, or
<i>fifty lire</i>, for being taught the stitch, described in
this book, by which it can be done. That it was a
great secret to an expert and accomplished needle-woman
proves that it cannot be generally known.
A house-furnisher in London doing a large business
once explained to me with manifest pride how he
had, by dint of persuasion and treating, obtained
from another what is really one of the simplest
recipes for restoring a brown stain. All of this being
true, it is apparent enough that any accomplished
mender and restorer, lady or gentleman, can hardly
fail to make a living by the art; and I sincerely believe
that it is the simple truth that it is set forth in
the following pages so fully and clearly that any one
who will make the experiment can learn from it how
to make a living. This is effectively, in all its fulness,
a new art and a new calling, and it is time that
it were established.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to suppose that manufacturers
are necessarily good menders of what they make. I
have found, as have my readers, that it is not the
great watchmaker who oversees the production of
thousands of watches to whom a watch can be most
safely trusted for rehabilitation. For, in nine cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
out of ten, it is some extremely humble brother of
the craft, who does nothing but mend in a small shop,
who restores your chronometer most admirably. The
same is true as regards trunks anywhere out of England,
since in Germany and France anything of the
kind is invariably botched with incredible want of
skill. This runs through most trades; for which
reason I believe that a really well-accomplished general
<i>mender</i>, earnestly devoted to the calling in every
detail and resolved to be perfect in it, could ere long
repair better than most manufacturers, since the latter,
in these days, all work by machinery or by vast
subdivision of labour, and not, so to speak, by hand.
But all repairing <i>must</i> be by hand. We can make
every detail of a watch or of a gun by machinery, but
the machine cannot mend it when broken, much less
a clock or a pistol!</p>

<p>The value of this book will appear to any one who
knows how little really good repairing there is in
Europe. Since writing the foregoing pages I have
gone through the galleries of the Vatican and many
other museums, and been amazed at the coarse, ignorant,
and bungling manner in which the <i>great majority</i>
of antique statues and other objects of immense value
have been mended up. There is in most cases no
pretence whatever to conceal the lines of repair, and
when this has been attempted it has failed through
ignorance of recipes and instructions which may be
found in this work.

<h2 class="xx-large">A MANUAL OF<br />

MENDING AND REPAIRING</h2>

<h2 id="MATERIALS_USED_IN_MENDING">MATERIALS USED IN MENDING</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>There are full many admirable and practical recipes</i>
(Hausmitteln), <i>which are often known only in certain
families</i>.”&mdash;Die Natürliche Magie. By <span class="smcap">Johann C.
Wiegleb</span>, 1782.</p></blockquote>

<p>The art of mending or of repairing may be broadly
stated as being effected, firstly, by mechanical processes,
such as those employed by carpenters in nailing
and joining, in embroidery with the needle, and
in metal-work with clumps, or soldering; and, secondly,
by chemical means. The latter consist of
<i>cements</i> and <i>adhesives</i>, which are, however, effectively
the same thing. This glue, or gum, is an adhesive
or <i>sticker</i>; that is, a simple substance which causes
two objects to adhere. The same, when combined
with powder of chalk or glass, would be a <span class="smcap">Cement</span>.
This latter term is again applied somewhat generally
and loosely by many, not only to all adhesives, but
also more correctly to all soft substances which
harden, such as Portland cement, mortar, and putty,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
and which are often used by themselves to form objects,
such as “bricks” and castings; but these latter,
having also the quality of acting as adhesives or
stickers, are naturally regarded as being the same.</p>

<p>As will be speedily observed in the great number
of recipes for mending which will be given in this
book, there are many which occur frequently in different
combinations; therefore it will be advisable
and indispensable for those who wish to master mending
as an art to indicate these as a basis.</p>

<p>As <span class="smcap">Sigmund Lehner</span> has observed in his valuable
work on <i>Die Kitte- und Klebemittel</i>, there have been
such vast numbers of recipes published of late years
for adhesives in various technological works, that the
combination of the usual materials depends almost on
the judgment of the experimenter, and every practical
operator will soon learn to make inventions of his
own. These materials, according to <span class="smcap">Stohmann</span>, may
be classified as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <td class="tdrt">I.</td>
    <td>Those in which <span class="smcap">Oil</span> is the basis.</td>

  </tr></table>

<p><span class="smcap">Oils</span> are divided into those (such as olive) which
never become hard, and the linseed, which in time
dries into a substance like gum. The latter combined
with a great variety of mineral substances, such as
plumbago, calcined lime, magnesia, chalk, red oxide
of iron, soapstone, or with varnishes, forms insoluble
“soaps,” which, as cements, resist water. They require
a long time to <i>set</i> or become hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Resins</span> and <span class="smcap">Gums</span> include a great number of substances,
such as resin or hard pitch, which is distilled
from pine-trees; shellac, mastic, elemi, copal, kauri
gum, amber, gum arabic, dextrine made from flour,
the gum of the peach and cherry, and of many other
trees. To these may be added frankincense and
tragacanth, which is less an adhesive than a stiffener
and dresser. Gums are generally rather brittle; this
is remedied by combination with oily substances, volatile
oils, or caoutchouc. With these gums <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>
includes asphaltum. The defect of such adhesives
is, as he also remarks, that they will not resist <i>high</i>
temperatures. This, however, will apply to most objects.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Varnish.</span>&mdash;This belongs properly to the gums, but
is technically regarded as a separate material. It is
gum in solution in turpentine or spirits. For details
vide <i>Die Fabrikation der Copal- Terpentinöl und Spiritus-Lacke</i>,
by L. E. Andés; Leipzig, price 5 m. 40 pf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caoutchouc</span> and <span class="smcap">Gutta-Percha</span> are gums which
when hard are still elastic, and resist the action of
water. I have read that a perfect imitation or substitute
for them has been made of turpentine, but have
not seen it, though I have met with glue made with oil
and turpentine, which very much resembled them in
elasticity or flexibility. Reduced to a liquid form
with ether, benzine, &amp;c., these gums can be kept in a
liquid state for a long time, and then hardened in any
form by exposure to the air. They enter into a very
great variety of cements, such as are meant to be
tough or waterproof. Indiarubber is, on the whole,
the best, and gutta-percha the cheapest, for cements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glue.</span>&mdash;This is made, by boiling, from horns and
bones; it is essentially the same as gelatine. It is
the most generally known of all adhesives, and may
be modified by certain admixtures to suit almost any
substance. It has the peculiarity that it must always
be boiled in a <i>balneum mariæ</i>, or in a kettle in hot
water in another kettle. Its strength is vastly increased
by admixture with nitric acid or <i>strong</i> vinegar.
On the subject of glue in all its relations, the
reader may consult <i>Die Leim- und Gelatine-Fabrikation</i>,
or “The Manufacture of Glue and Gelatine,” by F.
Dawidowsky; Vienna, price 3s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flour-Paste and Starch-Paste.</span>&mdash;These mixtures,
though generally used for weak work, such as
to make papers adhere, can be very much strengthened
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
by admixture with glue and gums. Combined
with certain substances, such as paper, mineral powders,
and <i>alum</i>, they, when submitted to pressure, become
intensely hard, and resist not only water but
heat, when not excessive. Also combined with varnishes
they are decided resistants. <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> speaks
of them as if they were perishable in any condition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturgeon’s Bladder.</span>&mdash;With this the bladders of
several kinds of fish are classed. Cut in small pieces
and dissolved in spirits it makes a very strong adhesive,
which is mixed with many others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime</span> is the most extensively used cement in the
world. Combined with water it forms mortar. It is
united with many substances, such as caseine or
cheese, the white of eggs, and silicate of soda, to
make powerful minor cements. On the subject of
lime the practical technologist should consult <i>Kalk
und Luftmortel</i>, by Dr. Herrmann Zwick; Vienna, A.
Hartleben, price 3s., in which all details of the subject
are given in full.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eggs.</span>&mdash;The yolk, and more particularly the white,
of eggs is sometimes used as an adhesive, and it
enters into many very excellent cements. For details
as to the chemistry and technology of this material
consult <i>Die Fabrikationen von Albumin- und Eierkonserven</i>
(A Full Account of the Characteristics of all
Egg Substances, the Fabrication of Egg, and Blood
Albumen, &amp;c.), by Karl Ruprecht; Vienna, A. Hartleben,
price 2s. 3d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neutral Substances, or Binding Materials.</span>&mdash;Almost
any substance not easily soluble in water,
and many which are, from common dust or earth,
or clay, sand, chalk, powdered egg-shells, sawdust,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
shell-powder, &amp;c., when combined with certain adhesives,
form cements. This is sometimes due to chemical
combination, but more frequently to mechanical
union. In the latter case the adhesive clinging to
every separate grain has the more points of adhesion,
just as a man by clinging with both hands to two
posts is harder to remove than if he held by one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caseine or Cheese.</span>&mdash;This in several forms, but
chiefly of curd in combination with several substances,
but mostly with lime or borax, forms a very valuable
cement. It is also combined with strong <i>lye</i> and silicate
of soda. It must not, however, be too much depended
on as a resistant to water or heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blood</span>, generally of oxen or cows, combined with
lime, alum, and coal ashes, forms a solid and durable
cement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glycerine</span> forms the basis, with plumbago, &amp;c., of
several cements. Like oil, it renders glue flexible
and partly waterproof. For chemical details on this
subject, vide <i>Das Glycerin</i>, by J. W. Koppe, Leipzig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gypsum</span> is combined with many substances to form
cements, some of them of great and peculiar value.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iron</span> pulverised is the basis of a great number of
very durable and strongly resistant cements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alum</span> may be included among the bases, as it is
very important in several compositions, forming a
powerful chemical aid. It is excellent as aiding resistance
to both moisture and heat. For an exhaustive
work on alum consult <i>Die Fabrikation des Alauns</i>,
&amp;c., by Frederic Junemann, which should be carefully
studied by all who work in cements.</p>

<p>There is a very great number of “indifferent” or
minor aids to these, such as sugar, milk, honey, spirits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
of wine, water, ochre, galbanum, tannin, ammonia,
feldspar, plumbago, sulphur, vinegar, salt, zinc (white),
umber, bismuth, tin, cadmium, clay, ashes, &amp;c.,
which are essential in certain combinations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dextrine</span>, the gum of flour or starch, or <i>Leiokom</i>,
much resembles gum-arabic, but is more brittle. Its
adhesiveness depends somewhat on the manner in
which it is dissolved. “It is,” says <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, “prepared
by heating starch which has been moistened
with nitric acid; also by warming paste with very
much diluted sulphuric acid.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wax</span>, including that of bees as well as paraffine, is
used in repairs, and forms a part of several cements.
On this subject consult <i>Das Wachs</i>, or “Wax and its
Technical Applications,” by Ludwig Sedna; Leipzig,
2s. 6d.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicate of Soda, or Liquid Glass.</span>&mdash;This is generally
sold in the form of a very dense liquid. It is
prepared by mixing quartz or flint sand with soda, or
more rarely with potash. “It is,” says <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, “a
glass which is distinguished from other glasses by
being easily soluble in water. It is believed to be a
very modern invention; but I have seen Venetian
glasses of the fifteenth century which appeared to be
painted with it, or something very similar; and I
have found decided indications of a knowledge of it
in two writers of the sixteenth century, <span class="smcap">Wolfgang
Hildebrand</span> and <span class="smcap">Van Helmont</span>. According to Wagner,
there are three kinds of liquid glass. By itself
liquid glass can only be used for mending glass; but
when combined with other substances, such as cement,
calcined lime, or clay, or glass, in powder, it forms a
body as hard as stone, or a double silicate, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
strongly resistant to chemical influences.” It occupies
the first position as an adhesive for glass, nor is
it surpassed as a cement in solid form. On this subject
vide <i>Wasserglas und Infusorienerde</i>, &amp;c., by Hermann
Krätzer; Vienna, 3s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Natural Cement, or Hydraulic Lime.</span>&mdash;This is
familiarly known to all readers as Portland cement,
but it is found of different qualities in many countries,
and is also made artificially. Certain mineral
substances have the quality when powdered and combined
with water of setting hard as stone; hence the
name <i>hydraulic</i>. I have seen at Budapest articles of
Portland cement made in Hungary which equalled in
appearance fine black slate or marble, and, while
much less brittle, were indeed in every respect more
durable and resistant to exposure. These artificial
cements can be largely incorporated with indifferent
substances, such as sand; they, however, require intense
baking, and may in consequence be regarded as
a kind of fictile ware.</p>

<p>Portland cement is very thoroughly treated in <i>Hydraulischer
Kalk und Portland Cement</i> (in all their relations),
by Dr. H. Zwick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tragacanth</span>, though called a gum, is properly
nothing of the kind, not being a true adhesive. It is
the product of the <i>Astragalus verus</i>, a tree found in
Asia. It swells out in water, and softens, but without
dissolving. It is more of a glaze than a paste;
hence it is used extensively by confectioners, bookbinders,
or to stiffen laces. It enters, however, into
the composition of several cements.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bread</span> may be classed as a material by itself, as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
derives certain peculiar virtues from the yeast which
causes its fermentation. With certain combinations
it becomes wax-like, or hard, and may be used to advantage
in many repairs as well as for modelling. It
has the great advantage of being easily worked and
always at hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celluloid</span> is treated of in this work under the head
of Artificial Ivory. It is made from gun-cotton and
camphor. For full information on this subject consult

<p><span class="smcap">Potatoes</span>, peeled and mashed, and kept for thirty-six
hours in a mixture of eight parts of sulphuric acid
to a hundred of water, and then dried and pressed,
form a white, hard substance very much like ivory,
or, as one may say, like white boxwood. <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>
expresses his doubt as to whether artificial meerschaum
pipes were ever made of this substance, but
I have seen them, and can testify that they looked
like meerschaum, and certainly were much harder
than <i>bruyere</i>, or briar-wood. Whether they will
“colour” I cannot say.</p>

<p>The principle by which potatoes, paper, and many
other substances can be hardened like parchment or
horn is curious. Potatoes consist of about seventy
per cent. water and twenty-five per cent. of starch,
the remainder being salts and <i>cellulose</i>, which forms
cells surrounded by the grains of starch. “When
such a substance is for some time brought into contact
with diluted sulphuric acid, that which results is
simply a contraction of the cells” (<i>i.e.</i>, a hardening),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
“or a kind of parchmenting.” Thus soft paper is
converted into parchment.</p>

<p>It is evident that chemistry is as yet in its infancy
as regards the conversion of cellulose by acid into
hard substances. Since cotton, paper, and potatoes
all produce by this process different substances, it is
probable that hundreds of organic, or at least vegetable,
substances will all yield new forms.</p>

<p>There is a marked difference between paste made
of <i>starch</i> or <i>flour</i>, each having its peculiar merits.
The former is principally prepared from potatoes.
To prepare the cement we mix it with a very little
water, stirring it very thoroughly till it assumes a
bluish appearance. A little more hot water is then
added, and the mass left till an opal-like tinge indicates
that it has formed. To this then add hot water
<i>ad libitum</i>. As it is almost colourless in very thin
coats, it is largely used to glaze and give body or
weight to, and often to simply falsify, woven fabrics,
which by its aid seem heavier. To increase this
weight white lead and other substances are used.</p>

<p>To make the best flour-paste, flour should be kneaded
in a bag under water till all the starch is washed
away. What remains is a substance closely allied to
caseine, or the white of egg. Combined with lime it
forms a hard cement. A very slight admixture of
carbolic acid (also oil of cloves) will keep paste from
souring or decay. This acid has the property of destroying
the growth of the minute vegetation which
constitutes fermentation, just as other strong scents
or perfumes are supposed to disinfect rooms, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A very great number of other ingredients, such as
the oxides of lead or zinc, manganese, baryta, sulphur,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
sal ammoniac, flint-sand, clay, salt, ochre, varnish,
galbanum, or frankincense, enter into certain
recipes, but those already given may be regarded as
constituting by far the principal portion of all cements
in ordinary use.

CROCKERY, MAJOLICA, TERRA-COTTA,
BRICK AND TILE WORK.</h2>

<p>Fictile or Ceramic ware embraces, roughly speaking,
all that is made of clay, or mineral bases or materials,
and which is subsequently baked to give it hardness.
The better the material and the more intense the heat,
or the greater the number of bakings to which most
kinds are subjected, the harder and more lasting will
they be. The old china ware which preceded porcelain,
a great many specimens of old Roman vessels,
and, for a more modern example, old Italian majolica
and Hungarian wine-pitchers, made all within a century,
are as hard as stone. They chip a great deal
before they break, just as agate might do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Terra-cotta</span> is simply earth or clay “baked.”
In most of the examples known as terra-cotta, earth
predominates. Pure fine clay well fired is superior
to what is generally called terra-cotta. Neither can
we really class with it articles made of superior Portland
cement, of which, as I have said, I have seen
many made at Budapest which were like the finest
hard slate.</p>

<p>Many writers confuse majolica with faïence; others
regard the latter as what we should call crockery, or
such ware as ranges between glazed terra-cotta and
porcelain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Majolica</span> consists generally of terra-cotta covered
with a glaze. A glaze is a fusible substance, we may
say a kind of glass, mixed with colouring matter,
which is at the same time a protection and an ornament.
Enamel is glass in fine powder melted, used
generally on metal or by itself. The base of the
paint is a substance fusible by heat which is mixed
with colours also fusible. Therefore when the painting
is submitted to heat it melts, adheres, and is permanent.
Glazing, enamelling, and china painting
are essentially the same.</p>

<p>Terra-cotta is not difficult to mend. I can best
illustrate this by an example. A friend once gave me
a terra-cotta vase from the Pyramid of Cholula, in
Mexico. These are supposed to be of very great antiquity.
This contained a fragment of pottery, probably
a sacred relic of ruder style, and I suppose of far
earlier times. The vase, however, had been broken
to fragments, and the owner was about to throw it
away as worthless. I begged it of him. Firstly, I put
the principal pieces together, using, to make them
adhere, glue with nitric acid. For finer work I should
have used Turkish cement or the best gum-mastic
dissolved in spirit or fish glue. Piece by piece with
care I reconstructed the whole.</p>

<p>There was wanting, however, one piece about three
inches square. I pasted with great care a piece of
paper inside the vase for a <i>back</i>, and then poured on
it plaster of Paris liquefied with water. To make this
<i>set</i> hard, the plaster or <i>gesso</i> should be made with
burnt alum-water and dissolved gum-arabic. This
exactly supplied the missing piece.</p>

<p>When it was finished, I filled in all the broken edges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
and other cavities with the plaster-paste, which set
even harder than the terra-cotta. The outer colour
of the vase was of reddish rusty black. I painted
the whole over with a corresponding colour; that
is to say, I rubbed it in by thumb, which is very different
from mere painting. By cementing and
rubbing I so restored the whole that the repair
was hardly perceptible. This process is carried
to great perfection in Italy with broken Etruscan
ware.</p>

<p>I may here remark as regards <i>rubbing in</i> oil or water
colours, that it is little known or practised, but it is of
great value in restoration when we wish to produce
certain curious antique-looking effects. I once knew
in Rome an artist who had bought for a trifle an old
carved <i>baule</i> or chest. By rubbing in with care on it
Naples yellow and brown shades, and subsequent
friction, he had made it look strangely like old ivory.
Mere painting, however skilfully performed, would
not have given it its antique ivory look. The same
artist had purchased one or two common, large, yellowish
terra-cotta wine-jars. He drew on them classical
figures, cut out the outlines a little with chisel
and file, and smoothing the figures with sandpaper,
also ivoried the whole by <i>rubbing in</i> colour. This was
but a few hours’ work, yet the effect was startling.
What had cost but a few francs would have sold for
hundreds. I should add that with the aid of fine retouching
flexible varnish this process could be very
much facilitated. Any one who can draw or paint at
all can try this experiment on any old piece of wood-carving,
or on a common yellow coarse earthenware.
Smooth the latter first with sandpaper, then rub in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the colours. The same is applicable to old carving
in marble.</p>

<p>All of these devices are of use to the restorer. As
regards restoration of terra-cotta, the field is wide
and profitable. Not only in Italy, but even in London,
we may find for sale broken Etruscan vases or
similar objects for a trifle, which are extremely easy
to restore. These are generally of red or light yellow
clay baked. If you have, let us say, a vase fractured,
obtain clay of the same colour&mdash;if you cannot
readily get it, take pipeclay&mdash;and colour it with a
strong infusion of red or yellow, though this is not
necessary if the exterior is black. Mix the clay well
with glue or gum-arabic and alum-water, supply the
missing portions, and let them harden. With a little
care and practice, remarkable restorations may thus
be made. I may here add that with this composition,
bottles, decanters, and cups can be coated, which,
when painted or rubbed in, exactly resemble Etruscan
or other ancient pottery. To prevent cracking, they
should first be painted with thick, coarse oil paint
mixed with sand or umber, which forms a ground.
Let it dry&mdash;the longer the better&mdash;and then rub in,
thinly, the gum and clay. There is another composition
of <i>blanc d’Espagne</i>, or whiting, and silicate of
soda, which sets even harder, but which is a little
more difficult at first to work, which may be used for
such restoration. This can be directly painted on
glass for a ground.</p>

<p><i>Majolica</i> or <i>Faïence</i> can generally be sufficiently well
mended with acidulated glue, but as the latter often
communicates a dark stain, it is better to use for fine
ware, or any which is to be used, the so-called Turkish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
cement. The best quality of this is made of the finest
quality of gum-mastic dissolved in spirit. It is so
tenacious that in the East gems are frequently directly
attached by means of it to metal, and they will often
break sooner than separate from it. Most chemists
have for sale, or will prepare for you, some form of it.
The silicate of potash and whiting can also be supplied
by chemists; they should be mixed with great
care, so as to form a medium paste, and then used
rapidly and with skill, because this cement hardens
very quickly. It is, however, a very powerful binder,
and sets as hard as glass.</p>

<p>Having put together and cemented the broken
pieces of a cup or vase, they must be kept in place till
the cement dries. This is effected by means of many
contrivances, regarding which the operator must employ
<i>some</i> original inventiveness. Firstly, the pieces
can often be simply tied, or attached by pieces of
tape, or parchment, or paper glued on. In other cases
india-rubber bands are useful. Again, bits of wood,
or sticks and wires, are the things useful. A bed of
wax is generally a sure guard. It is best to do this
with great care, and not impatiently rely on holding
the pieces together with the fingers till they stick.
This is often the most difficult part of the whole operation;
therefore it should be done well and deliberately.
And here it may be remarked that, as in surgery,
the most complicated cases of fracture may be
studied out and adjusted; for which reason I dare
say that skilful surgeons would be good menders of
crockery, just as good astronomers are always good
riflemen.</p>

<p>When the broken pieces are adjusted and all is dry,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
there remain the chips, hollows, ragged edges, and
“hairs,” as the French call them, or lines of juncture,
to be filled and smoothed. This is done with
the cement which you employ, according to the quality
of the material, either plaster and gum-arabic, silicate
and whiting, or powdered chalk. Some experts
succeed with white of an egg and finely powdered
quicklime, which holds firmly, but which requires
practice to amalgamate. Fill the cavities carefully,
pressing the cement well in, as the Romans did, with
a stick or point. When all is smooth, paint over the
blank spaces and varnish with Sohnée, No. 3, or with
a slight coating of silicate. Fine copal varnish is
rather tougher or less brittle.</p>

<p>The most thorough process of all is to unite the
fragments with a vitreous or metallic <i>flux</i>, such as the
silicate&mdash;there are several of these&mdash;and then have the
work baked or fired. It can then be painted with
porcelain colours under glaze, and fired again. As
this is very delicate, difficult, and expensive, few
amateurs will care to try it. It is, however, perfect,
and by means of it the most complete reparation can
be effected. The Japanese do this simply with the
blow-pipe, by means of which they fix enamel powders
even on wood. This use of the pipe is also difficult,
but the ancient Romans are said to have employed
the process with most minor work. As a
thread of glass will melt in a candle, and as fine-glass
powder is equally fusible, it can be understood that
under the flame of a blow-pipe the latter can often
be melted so as to avail in restoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crockery, or Faïence, and Porcelain.</span>&mdash;“Crockery,”
by which we commonly understand such ware
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
as that of the blue willow plates, is far superior to
terra-cotta, since its <i>core</i> or basis is thin, and very
hard, and its gloss of a different description, and more
incorporated with the body; or it is of a single superior
body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porcelain</span> differs entirely from the other two kinds
of fictile ware, being an elaborate mineralogical compound,
its base being <i>kaolin</i>, a friable, white, earthy
substance, requiring great care in its preparation, and
<i>petunse</i>, or feldspar, which is united with the <i>kaolin</i>.
The result is a very delicate and beautiful diaphanous
ware, or one through which light passes to a limited
degree. Both crockery and porcelain are far more
difficult to mend, owing to the impossibility&mdash;particularly
with the latter&mdash;of making fractures disappear.</p>

<p>The first and most simple process of mending both
kinds of ware is to make small holes with a drill
along the edges of the fracture, and then, adjusting
the fragments, bind them together with wire. <span class="smcap">M.
Ris-Paquot</span> claims that “the honour of this discovery
belongs properly to a humble and modest workman
named <span class="smcap">Delille</span>, of the little village of Montjoye,
in Normandy.” But the archæologist will say
of this claim, as the English judge did of a similar
one, that the plaintiff might as well apply for a patent
for having discovered the art of mixing brandy with
water, since there was probably never yet a savage
who had wire, or even string, who did not know
enough to mend broken calabashes, jars, and pipes
by this solid method of sewing. From the time when
large earthen punch-bowls were first used in Europe,
we find them mended with silver wire. It is needless
to devote whole pages with illustrations, as <span class="smcap">M. Ris-Paquot</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
has done, to show how to effect such mending.
The holes are made with either a bore or hand
drill, such as can be bought in every tool shop. If
the reader will obtain one and experiment with it on
any penny plate or broken fragment, he will soon
master all the mystery. The wire is made fast by a
turn with a pair of nippers or pincers. Before fastening,
wash the edges of the ware with white of egg in
which a very little whiting, or finely powdered lime
or plaster of Paris, has been mixed.</p>

<p>I may here observe that the wire for china-drilling
should be half round, or flat on one side. To prepare
this, take brass wire, say a length of about two
feet, and, holding an old knife, draw the wire firmly
and steadily against it.</p>

<p>There are endless cements for sale by chemists, all
warranted perfect, to mend glass and china, and most
of them do indeed answer the purpose very well, for
nature has given us not a few materials wherewith to
repair accidents. Thus, even boiling in milk will
often suffice to reunite broken edges. But I believe
that of all, the Turkish cement already described,
which is made of gum <small>MASTIC</small> (a term improperly applied
in France to putty, by Americans to lime-plaster
on houses, and by Levantines to spirit with resin
in it), is the most adhesive and resistant to heat, cold,
or moisture.</p>

<p>The art of mending does not consist so much of
knowing what to use for an <small>ADHESIVE</small> (since, as I have
said, every chemist’s shop abounds in these) as in skill
and tact with which fragments are brought and kept
together, missing portions supplied, and in knowing
the substance with which to fill a blank. There are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
cases in which, when a hole has been knocked in a
china or glass plate, it can be drilled out round, and a
disc of the same substance or colour, or even of another,
inserted. This is almost an art by itself, and by means
of it very singular and puzzling effects may be introduced;
as, for instance, when a number of holes are
drilled in a white china plate and then filled with
discs of coloured china, agate, coral, &amp;c. In the
East, turquoise and coral beads are often thus set into
porcelain, as well as wood. The mastic or acidulated
glue is used to make the objects inserted hold firmly.</p>

<p>As the smoker, when he breaks his pipe across the
stem, has it repaired with a short silver slide or tube,
so when a china jar is broken across the neck, the
reparation can be concealed by a silver collar, which
is sometimes a great improvement; as, for instance,
when the head of a china dog, or even of a china man,
is taken off. But in a great many cases, or in all
where this kind of concealment is advisable, it may
be made, like Cæsar’s wife, beyond suspicion, by
making the collar or concealing ornament, or leaf or
flower, of silicate and whiting so as to resemble the
ware itself, which can be done very nicely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicate of Soda</span> is sometimes sold in the form of
a dry solid, which is placed in a little vinegar, and
warmed. When dissolved it can be used <i>ad libitum</i>.
It is often used as a glaze for stone.</p>

<p>There is a curious old story about mending broken
crockery by means of magic&mdash;or rather by deceit&mdash;which,
though not of a practical nature, is at least
amusing. It is partially told in a book published
about 1670, entitled <i>Joco-Seriorum Naturæ et Artis
Magiæ Naturales Centuriæ Tres</i>. It happened once in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Mergentheim that there was a great fair, when the
whole courtyard of the palace was full of earthenware
vessels for sale <i>ab assidentibus muliebibus</i> (by attendant
women). Seeing this, the Prince of Mergentheim
went about among these women, and so arranged it
that they divided all their stock into two parts, or
exact duplicates, half of which they hid away, while
the other half was exposed for sale. While at dinner
the Prince spoke much of magic, and professed to be
able to produce such a delirium in people’s minds
that they would act like lunatics. “Thus, for instance,”
he said, pointing casually out of the window,
“you see all those women. I can drive them
mad at once.” Whereupon one who was present
wagered a handsome carriage and four horses that
the Prince could not do it. The latter smiled, waved
his hand, and uttered a spell, when lo! all at once
the market-women began, <i>bacchantium more</i>&mdash;like raging
Bacchantæ&mdash;to attack their crockery with sticks
and stools, and hurl it about, and dash it to pieces.</p>

<p>The one who had betted the chariot protested
that it was a trick arranged beforehand. The Prince
replied, “Well, the pots are all broken. If I can
mend them again by a spell, wilt thou then believe?”
The other said, “Most certainly.” Then the Prince
waved his wand and said, “It is done. Let us go
down into the courtyard and see.” And when there,
sure enough they found the pots all whole again&mdash;at
least they discovered others exactly like them in their
places.</p>

<p>The legend continued that the Prince, though he
kept the carriage and horses as a trophy, liberally
paid for them. The author of the <i>Tres Centuriæ</i>, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
does not record the secret of the little arrangement,
declares that he does not know whether it was all
done by a fraud or by magic. If it was the latter, I
regret that the incantation by which broken crockery
is mended is now lost. The most powerful spell
known to me is <i>Recipe Gummæ Mastichæ duæ unciæ cum
Spirito Vini fiat mixtio</i>&mdash;that is, mastic cement. It is
generally combined with sturgeon’s bladder glue.</p>

<p>This cement answers very well for glass. One of
the old recipes, which was very good indeed, is thus
given by <span class="smcap">Johannes Wallburger</span> (1760):&mdash;“Take
finely cut and a little powdered sturgeon’s bladder”
(still sold by all chemists), “soften it all night in
spirits, add to this a little clean and powdered mastic,
boil it a little in a brass pan. Should it become too
thick, add a little spirits.” This may be also used for
many other purposes.</p>

<p>A strong but coarser adhesive, especially for crockery
and stone, can be made as follows:&mdash;Take old
and hard goat’s milk cheese, and warm it in hot water
till it forms, by pounding, a mass like turpentine.
Add to this, while grinding, finely pulverised quicklime
and the well-shaken white of eggs.</p>

<p>I do not hesitate to give a variety of such recipes,
because in every one the artist will find valuable suggestions
for other purposes than simply glueing
broken articles together. This latter is a valuable
“filler” for many purposes. Glue was formerly
made into a strong cement by boiling it for a time in
water, but before it had become incorporated with the
water, the latter was poured off and strong spirits
substituted and stirred well in.</p>

<p>A very popular old cement for crockery, of which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
there were several variations, was made by mixing
glue, turpentine, ox-gall, the juice of garlic, and
sturgeon-bladder, tragacanth, and mastic. All of
this singularly smelling mixture was put into a pan
and boiled in strong spirits, such as whisky, then
kneaded on a board under a roller, again boiled with
more spirits, yet again rolled, and this was repeated
a third time, and then cooled till it could be cut into
cakes. When these were to be used they were again
steeped in spirits. But with this cement, glass or
metal could be most firmly attached to wood. I confess
that I have never tried it, but it was evidently a
very strong cement.</p>

<p>Another of these somewhat complicated recipes for
crockery, glass, and porcelain, which I find in the
<i>Tausandkünstler</i>, 1782, is as follows:&mdash;Half an ounce
of finely cut sturgeon’s bladder, two teaspoonfuls of
alabaster powder or gypsum, quarter of an ounce of
tragacanth, one teaspoonful of silberglatt, two of powdered
mastic, two of frankincense, two of gum-arabic,
one of Marienglas, one tablespoonful of spirits of
wine, one of beer-vinegar. Boil it and stir, and apply.
Any drops sticking to the mended article may
be removed with vinegar. When it is to be used
again revive it by heating, adding spirits of wine and
beer-vinegar. The gum-frankincense is here worth
noting.</p>

<p>A common cement for mending broken glass or
china is prepared as follows:&mdash;To two parts of gum-shellac
add one of turpentine; boil them over a slow
fire, and form the mass into small cakes before it dries.
To use it, warm with a lamp. To mend ivory or
wood, take a cake and let it dissolve in spirits of wine.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>A very strong cement is made as follows:&mdash;Take
one ounce of finely powdered mastic dissolved in six
of spirits of wine and two ounces of shredded sturgeon’s
bladder dissolved in two ounces common
spirits; add one half ounce of <i>gum-ammoniac</i> as it
hardens; warm it when it is to be used. This is as
strong a cement as can be made.</p>

<p>Defects, cracks, and repairs in porcelain, &amp;c., may
often be concealed as follows:&mdash;Paint the spot with
silicate of soda, not too much thinned, and dust it over
before it dries with bronze powder. This will set so
hard that it may be polished with an agate burnisher.</p>

<p>It is also possible that many of my readers have
heard of <i>gesso painting</i>, an art perfected by Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter
Crane</span>. This consists of painting with plaster of
Paris in solution, with the point of a brush, depositing
the soft paste in relief. The same principle is
applicable to painting in silicate and whiting on glass
surfaces. By means of it decoration can be given to
any glass bottle or other object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lime</span> enters into the composition of many cements,
the simplest being the mortar formed by its admixture
with water. But the quality of this is very much
determined by that of the lime. The <i>chunam</i> of
India, which resembles white marble or a fine white
stone, is made of sea-shells burned to lime. A wonderfully
hard, fine, white cement used by the Romans
for their best mosaic-work, and which set with great
rapidity, was made of shell-lime with the white of
eggs. I have found the same composition worthless
when made with inferior stone-lime.</p>

<p>A good cheap cement for porcelain and glass is
combined as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starch or wheat flour</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>

    <td class="tdr">24</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>Pour a part of the spirits and water mixed on
the flour and chalk, add the glue, boil it down till
the latter dissolves, and stir the turpentine into the
whole. This can be used to make artificial wood
with shavings or sawdust.</p>

<p>A very good cement for porcelain, and one which
is colourless, is made by cutting the finest clear gelatine
into bits, and dissolving it in vinegar of 50°, stirring
it in a porcelain vessel until well mixed. When
cold it will harden, but softens under the influence of
heat, when it may be applied to the broken edges of
the porcelain, which are to be pressed together. It
will be perfectly hard within twenty-four hours. It
is to be observed that the art of keeping such joined
pieces together is the most difficult problem in mending.
This cement is widely applicable to many objects,
and also admits of considerable modification
and additions, like all cements. As it is colourless,
it may be combined with ivory dust, or white powders
of baryta, magnesia, whiting, &amp;c., to form artificial
ivory with glycerine. With sturgeon’s bladder it
makes a still stronger cement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lehner</span> observes that glue has the property, when
combined with acid chrome salt (<i>sauren chromsalzen</i>),
of losing its solubility when exposed to the light, so
that it can be used as a cement for broken porcelain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and glass. If the juncture is to be invisible, take the
purest white gelatine; otherwise the cheaper gilder’s
glue will answer. To prepare the chrome glue, dissolve
the gelatine or the glue in boiling water, then
add the solution of double chromic acid alkali, or the
red chrome alkali of commerce, stir it well up, and
put it into tin boxes.</p>

<p>The formula is:&mdash;</p>

<p>To use, warm the cement, apply it to the broken
glass, which must then be exposed for several hours
to the sunshine.</p>

<p>Cracked bottles are mended by a very ingenious
process, described by <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>. The bottle is corked,
but not tightly, and then exposed to heat about 100°
centigrade. Then the cork is driven in tightly, which
causes an expansion of the cracks, which are at once
filled by means of a finely pointed brush with the
silicate. Removed to a cooler place the glass contracts
on the as yet fluid silicate, and the fractures
are mended.</p>

<p>This must be very quickly stirred and applied.
This is one of the <i>hardest</i> and best cements, and it
resists heat and other influences so well that when
very carefully amalgamated it may be applied to the
manufacture of many useful articles. The same may
be made with the substitution of white pipeclay for
fluor spar, or with the addition of the same in somewhat
larger proportion. Pipeclay or any good clay
can also be combined with glycerine to prevent its
drying. With gelatine and a <i>little</i> glycerine it will
harden and not crack.</p>

<p>This requires careful amalgamation and rapid work.</p>

<p>To prepare very fine glass-powder for this cement,
heat any glass till red-hot, then drop it into cold
water. It may then be reduced in a mortar to an impalpable
powder.</p>

<p>Earthenware tubes or pipes which are to be exposed

<p>To prepare <i>caseine</i> cement for crockery or marble, it
may be observed that we should always take <i>fresh</i>
white cheese and macerate or knead it thoroughly till
only pure <small>CASEINE</small> adding to this one-third

ingredients very thoroughly we get a very strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>

forms a powerful cement.</p>

<p>The following for tile-work and common brick-crockery,
or terra-cotta or porcelain, is very highly
commended by <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, who says that anything
mended with it will sooner break in another place
than where it is cemented:&mdash;</p>

<p>The cement is mixed with water, and the tile or

<p>I cannot insist too strongly on this&mdash;that no one is
to expect that by simply taking recipes, as written,
compounding and applying them, there will be a
successful result at the first trial. We must always
have the best material, often fresh, and generally attempt
the application more than once. <i>Perseverando
vinces</i>&mdash;“By perseverance you will conquer.” Not
only must the <i>quality</i> of the ingredients used be of the
best, but the composition be made exactly in the
order in which they are given. The same substances
often give very different results, simply because the
order of combination in the two was different.</p>

it can be polished. It is the principal, and almost
the only, cement used by <span class="smcap">M. Ris-Pacquot</span>, or commended
in his work on mending crockery. It admits
of a great variety of modifications. It is very superior
as a bed for mosaics of all kinds. It forms, like
the preceding, also a good bed for scagliola and
ceresa.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> I would here say of the latter, that I could
wish to see it more generally used for mural or wall
ornament, since any one who can paint a face or decoration
boldly and largely in oil or water colours will
find it very easy. It admits of rapid execution, and
is striking from its brilliancy. Everything in it depends
on having a good bed to which it can easily
adhere. I may here observe that beds like these
which set hard and <i>fine</i> are also adapted to fresco-painting,
in which the difficulty is to select colours
which, when absorbed and dried, do not fade. Most
paints made from mineral substances combine with
silicate of soda.</p>

<p>I may here remark that a curious and easy art, very
little known, consists of carving or cutting low reliefs
on tiles or terra-cotta or brick-like ware, which, when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
outlined or in relief, can be glazed in colour with
silicate of soda; also with many other cements.</p>

makes an admirable bed for mosaics or ceresa.</p>

<p>When plaster of Paris is simply combined with
burnt alum in water, the objects mended with it require
several weeks to set or adhere. Gypsum combined
with gum alone holds firmly, but does not resist

<p><span class="smcap">Lehner</span> has in his work on Cements many valuable
suggestions as to mending porcelain. <i>Firstly</i>, that in
such mending, the adhesive be applied with care, in
as even and as thin a coat as possible; to which I
would add, that the unskilful amateur is apt to daub
it on irregularly and carelessly, with the impression
that the more cement there is the better it will stick,
which is just so far wrong that every superfluous
grain is just so much of an impediment to good drying
or adhesion. Again, the inexpert daubs it on
with a stick or “anything,” when a fine-pointed
brush or hair-pencil should be used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Broken china which is to be mended</span> should be
carefully covered away so as to protect it from dust,
which is hard to clean off. Beware of fitting the
pieces together again and again, as is often done.</p>

<p>If the broken china was used to contain milk or
soup, &amp;c., it should be laid in lye to dissolve all the
fatty substance, and then be washed with clear water.
Painted porcelain cannot, however, be laid in lye,
which would ruin all the colours; in this case wipe
them clean with dilute acid.</p>

<p>The great difficulty in mending is to bring the
pieces together and keep them so till the adhesive
dries. <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> recommends that when objects are
small and costly, a mould of gypsum be constructed
round them. In most cases putty or wax is far more
manageable. As before remarked, indiarubber bands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
are chiefly to be relied on; even if not capable of
holding permanently, they aid greatly in tying with
cord.</p>

<p>In the Manual of <span class="smcap">F. Goupil</span>, rewritten by <span class="smcap">Frederick
Dillaye</span>, the following method of restoring
broken vases, &amp;c., is commended:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Form a solid mass of clay in the form of the original
object. Then place on it, one by one, the fragments
in their place, keeping the clay moist. When
this is done, paste over the exterior strips of paper,
in sufficient quantity to hold the whole firmly together.
Then remove the moist clay, and paste
strong slips of paper” (or thin parchment) “over the
interior so as to hold the whole. Then” (when dry)
“carefully moisten and remove the outer coating.”</p>

<p>The author mentions that this is only applicable to
vases the mouth of which is wide enough to permit
the hand to be introduced. I would here, however,
add, that even when it is too small for this purpose,
the restoration can be equally well effected as follows:&mdash;Make
the core of wet clay, or, better, of beeswax,
then paste over it thin tough paper. Cover this
with gum-arabic solution, and set the pieces on it.
When dry, melt out the wax or clay.</p>

<p>Fish-gum, <i>colle de poisson</i>&mdash;that is to say, what is
generally called <i>sturgeon’s bladder</i>, which includes the
bladder of several kinds of fishes dissolved&mdash;is best
for glass, marble, porcelain, and all kinds of mending
where the cement should not show. This, when combined
with oil, is <i>said</i>, if mixed with cloth-dust and
fibre of wool or silk or cotton, to spin up into thread.

<p>Putty is naturally the first cement which suggests
itself in connection with the mending of glass, since
this latter material is most familiar to the world in
the form of windows, although in many places&mdash;as,
for instance, Florence, where it is called <i>mastico</i> and
<i>pasta</i>&mdash;it is little used or known. The word is from
the French <i>potée</i>, which also means a potful. It is
very useful, not only for setting glass-panes, but for
filling holes in wood, and forms a part of certain mixtures
as a cement for moulding ornaments. It may
be weak and brittle, or else strong and very hard,
according to the manner in which it is prepared. It
is commonly made by combining chalk in paste, with
water, with linseed-oil; other powders are also used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
In America it is made with pulverised soap-stone and
oil. Its excellence depends on the quality of the oil
and the care with which it is kneaded. It should be
kept in a damp cellar, in wet cloth or under water.
Should it dry and become brittle, fresh oil must be
added.</p>

<p>“<i>To take hard old putty from glass window-panes</i>, cover
it with a mixture of one part of calcined lime, two of
soda, and two of water” (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>). Oxide of lead
combined with oil makes an excellent but yellow
putty. It sets very hard.</p>

<p>The white or grey oxide of zinc combined with linseed-oil
or linseed-oil varnish makes a cement which
is used for making glass adhere to wood or metal.</p>

<p><i>Thick lacquers</i>, such as copal or amber, may be used
instead of common varnish with better effect, and the
composition is better when calcined lime or oxide of
lead are added. The excellence of the cement depends
on the degree to which the ingredients are
amalgamated or rubbed in together; and this rule
holds good for all similar mixtures.</p>

<p><i>Varnish</i>, or heavy or “flat” lacquer of copal or amber,
forms of itself a strong adhesive, with the only
drawback that it takes a long time to dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very good cement for glass</span> (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>) is as follows:</p>

<p>This is a glue of general application, and specially

<p>The reader who would thoroughly study the subject
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of glass may consult <i>Die Glas-Fabrikation</i>, a very admirable
work by Raimund Gerner, glass manufacturer;
A. Hartleben, Vienna and Leipzig, price 4s. 6d.</p>

<p>Small triangles of sheet tin or iron are often used
to fasten panes.</p>

<p>The mending of broken glass is in most cases much
the same as that of broken crockery or porcelain.
The cement made from mastic, or mastic combined
with sturgeon’s bladder, or generally of silicate with
whiting, is the proper adhesive. As silicate of soda
is simply liquid glass, it can be employed to fill spaces
or to make glass; but, owing to its sticky nature, it
is hard to manage. This may be often effected by
first preparing a layer of soft paper, on which successive
coats of silicate are laid. When dry the paper
can be washed away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicate of Soda</span> has become of such importance
that a French work on mending fictile ware is almost
entirely limited to its use as a binder, when combined
with whiting. <i>Water-glass</i> was long supposed to be
a modern invention, till some one found it described
in Van Helmont’s works, <small>A.D.</small> 1610. But I have
found it also in the <i>Joco-seriorum Naturæ</i>, 1545; in the
<i>Magia Naturalis</i> of Wolfgang Hildebrand, which is of
the same time; and, finally, by <i>Paracelsus</i> (<i>Liber de
Præparationibus</i>), where he describes it as <i>Destillatio
Crystalli</i>. And the author of the <i>Joco-seriorum</i> speaks
of soft glass as a thing which had been treated by
several writers.</p>

<p>According to <span class="smcap">Wagner</span> there are three kinds of soluble
glass&mdash;(i.) the soluble potash glass, 45 silex, 3
charcoal, 34 carb. potass.; (ii.) soluble soda glass,
100 pts. quartz, 60 cal. sulp. soda, 15 of charcoal;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
(iii.) double soluble glass, 100 quartz, 22 cal. soda, 28
carb. potass., 6 wood-coal. Water-glass combines
well with any “indifferent” powder, such as powdered
glass, to make a strong cement. To powder glass,
heat it red-hot, drop it into cold water and pulverise
it. It will become as fine as flour, and in this state
combines with gum-arabic, or glue, or gums to make
a powerful glass-mender. Mixed with powdered
glass, oxide of zinc, or whiting, powdered marble,
calcined bone, plaster of Paris, wood-ashes, &amp;c.,
it can be worked like putty. Mixed with colours
it is used for stereochrome painting, a kind of
fresco.</p>

<p>Missing pieces of glass, such as leaves from a chandelier,
can be easily replaced with water-glass, and
all cracks or defects glazed over with it.</p>

<p>This mending is allied, however, to certain processes
in art which are so interesting that I venture
on a description of them.</p>

<p>A great deal of mending and restoring in glass can
be effected by means of the blow-pipe and spirit-lamp
or gas-flame. Difficult as this may sound, it is not
only an easy, but also a very curious and entertaining,
occupation. In any city an expert or workman
may be found who would give a few lessons. I have
very often been impressed with the fact that so little
artistic invention or originality is found in glass-work.
Even the far-famed Venetian work is extremely limited,
and “mannered” or conventional, compared to
what it might be.</p>

<p>The following is an old recipe for repairing glass:&mdash;Take
finest powdered glass, best mastic, with equal
parts of white resin and distilled turpentine. Melt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
all well together. To use, gradually warm it and
then apply.</p>

<p>Quicklime and white of egg, intimately rubbed into
one another on a flat surface, make a good cement
for ordinary glass or pottery.</p>

<p>The cement of <i>gum-arabic</i> is much stronger when
made as follows:&mdash;Take gum-arabic and dissolve it
in acetic acid (vinegar) instead of water. It must be
melted in a hottish place, as it will in that case be
much better. The finest quality of sheet-gelatine
makes a transparent glue, invaluable where colour is
to be avoided.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To mend a cracked Glass Bottle or Decanter.</span>&mdash;Heat
the bottle, pressing in the cork, till the hot
air within expands the cracks, which must be at once
filled with the liquid glass. Then, as the water-glass
is driven in by the pressure of the outer air, as the
bottle cools the cracks are closed.</p>

<p>You cannot well mend a broken looking-glass, but
something can be done with the large pieces. Varnish
or paste a piece of paper and lay it on the quicksilver.
Then with an American glass-cutter, price
one shilling, or a diamond-cutter, divide them into
squares for small mirrors. Two of these of equal
size can easily be converted into a folding kaleidoscope
(not described by <span class="smcap">Brewster</span> in his work on the
Kaleidoscope). Lay the two pieces face to face, and
paste over the whole, on the quicksilvered side, a
piece of thin leather or muslin. When dry, with a
penknife, cut a slit down between the two on three
sides. It will then open and shut like a portfolio.
This may serve as a travelling, looking or shaving
glass, but it is very useful to designers of patterns.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Place the glass upright on a table at a right angle, or
more or less, and lay between the mirrors any object
or a pattern, and you will see it multiplied from three
to twelve times, according to the angle. Beautiful
variations of designs can thus be made, <i>ad infinitum</i>.
They may be used as reflectors, when placed behind
a light.</p>

<p>Take such a piece of looking-glass and lay a piece
of paper on the back, and then with an agate or ivory
point write or draw on it, but not as hard as to break
the silvering. Then turn it to the sun or a strong
light, and let the reflection fall on a white surface.
Though nothing be perceptible on the face of the
mirror, the writing will appear in the reflection.</p>

<p>Glass is engraved as metal is etched; with this exception,
that, instead of sulphuric or nitric acids,
fluoric acid is used. Both glass and <i>china</i> can also be
directly etched with a steel point, aided by emery
powder; which latter art I have never seen described,
but which I have successfully practised. It is fully
set forth in my forthcoming work on “One Hundred
Arts.”</p>

<p>Malleable glass, or at least that which does not
break easily when let fall, is prepared by dipping the
objects made from it, while quite hot, into oil. I conjecture
that panes of window-glass thus prepared
would not be broken by hail, as I have observed that
plate-glass is not.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that goblets of thin glass&mdash;especially
those which have had a peculiar kind of annealing
or tempering&mdash;ring beautifully when blown
on so as to vibrate them. The effect is almost magical
on one who hears it for the first time. I mention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
it that the reader may, when he finds old Venetian or
any other thin glass goblets for sale, see if there be
not among them a finely ringing one. An organ
could be thus made to play by wind. With regard
to music on glass, take any ordinary bottle, and by
rubbing on it a cork a little wetted you can, with a
little practice, produce a startling imitation of the
chirping, and even warbling, of birds. I knew one
who could thus imitate to perfection nightingales and
call forth responsive songs. The effect depends in a
degree on the quality of the cork, and also that of the
glass. With a violin-bow very musical sounds may
be drawn from the edge of a pane of glass. It seems
as if these methods might also be developed into musical
instruments. It is well known that tubes of glass
suspended when a candle is placed beneath them give
forth musical sounds, often of great richness and
strength. There are also the musical glasses, which
may be played in two ways, either by rubbing the
edges with a wetted finger or by filling the glasses
more or less with water till an octave is formed, and
then tapping them with a stick of wood. All of
which has, indeed, nothing to do with mending glass,
yet which may not be without interest to those who
wish to learn all its qualities.</p>

<p>Among <span class="smcap">Glass Cements</span> in common use which can
be recommended are the well-known Polytechnic,
also the Imperial Liquid Glue (no heating required),
Hayden &amp; Co., Warwick Square, London. There is
also a very good glass cement made and sold by Keye,
filter-maker, Hill Street, Birmingham.</p>

<p>The Venetians made ordinary glass goblets very
beautiful by painting on them in relief with a substance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
which I suspect was in some cases a form of
silicate, or else with a kind of paint which was not
enamel, yet which seems to have been partly vitreous.
It rather resembles oil paint with glass powder, but
I doubt if it was this.</p>

<p>Working in glass implies the mending and restoration
of stained-glass windows; that is, of painting on
glass and a study of designs. Of all this there is
almost a literature. Among other works I can commend
<i>A Book of Ornamental Glazing Quarries</i>, by A. W.
Franks, £1, 1s.; <i>Divers Works of Early Masters in
Ecclesiastical Decoration</i>, by Owen Jones, £3, 10s.;
<i>Westlake’s History of Stained Glass</i>, vol. i., <i>Fourteenth
Century</i>, 13s. 6d.; vol. iii., <i>Fifteenth Century</i>, 18s., published
by Batsford, 52 High Holborn. At Rimmel’s,
in Oxford Street, the reader can generally obtain
these, and all works on similar subjects at prices
much below the original cost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A mending cement for glass</span> is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Common cheese</td>

    <td>Slacked lime</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>This is found in many books of recipes. It must
be observed that the cheese is to be for sometime
carefully pounded with the water till quite soft, and
the lime then very quickly stirred in. This is not only
useful to mend glass, but can be applied to many
other purposes. The cheese is best when fresh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caseine</span> (or pure cheese) can be combined with
ease with liquid silicate of soda (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>), and thus
forms a very strong cement for porcelain or glass, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
any other material. Fill a flask with one-fourth of
fresh caseine to three-fourths of silicate, and shake it
thoroughly and frequently.</p>

<p>Another formula is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caseine</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Silicate of soda</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>This must be used very promptly, and the article
mended dried in the air.</p>

<p>A <small>CEMENT</small> which may be used in several combinations
is made by dissolving fresh acidulated caseine
(made by adding vinegar to milk, and carefully washing
the deposit) in a very little caustic lye. It must
be kept corked in bottles.</p>

<p>These <i>caseine</i> or cheese or curd cements hold well,
but do not well resist water, except in powerful combination.</p>

<p>The excellence of cements depends to a great degree
on the quality of the materials and the scrupulous
observance of care in making. Thus for the following,
for glass:&mdash;</p>

<p>in which we have one of the commonest and oldest
formulas, the value depends on “the make-up” that
is, the glue must be left in cold water for two days,
then boiled in a <i>balneum mariæ</i>, or a double kettle, in
lukewarm water; that is, it must not boil, or the
glue will be weakened.</p>

<p>The so-called <span class="smcap">Diamond</span> or <span class="smcap">Turkish Cement</span>, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
glass or any other fine work, has been known since
early times as incredibly strong. Its formula, according

is reserved from the others, and added <i>after</i> they are
mingled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A strong base for a cement for glass</span>, as well as
wood or stone, is made by gradually stirring finely
sifted wood-ashes into silicate of soda, or strong acid
glue, till a syrup-like substance results. In America
the best ashes for this purpose are those of the hickory.
Perhaps beech wood yields them equally good.</p>

<p>There is a <span class="smcap">Diamond Cement</span> which is of special
value to attach gems to rings or metal, to make coral
or pearl or ivory adhere together, and, in short, for
all fine work where a very strong adhesive is required.

<p>The sturgeon’s bladder is cut into small pieces and
steeped in the spirits, and the rest, in solution, then
added. It must be warmed again when used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>As this cement will bear long exposure to moisture
before being at all injured by it, it can be used as a
medium for painting on glass, and thereby producing
effects very little inferior, either as regards beauty or
durability, to glass itself. The experiment can be
easily tried, as any chemist can make up the recipe.
When finished, the painting can be coated with liquid
silicate of soda, which will give it all the property of
glass.</p>

<p>The reader who desires to be perfectly informed as
to glass in all its relations can obtain, by application
to <span class="smcap">J. Baer</span>, Rossmarkt, Frankfort on the Main, Germany,
a catalogue which is perhaps the most extensive
on the subject ever published.</p>

<p>Coloured or stained glass windows may be repaired
or made by the following process, which has the advantage
of being quite as durable as any in which the
colours are burned in:&mdash;Take two panes of glass, and
paint on one your pattern with fine varnish and transparent
colour mixed. When dry, go over the whole,
with a broad, soft brush, with a liquid mastic cement,
which must be quite transparent and thin. Any
transparent strong cement will serve, but it is advisable
to use the mastic in all cases as a narrow border
and at the edges. If you have an engraving, especially
one on very soft spongy paper, take a pane of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
glass, cover it with a coat of varnish, and just before
it dries press the engraving face down, on it. When
quite dry, with a sponge slightly damped and the end
of the finger, peel away all the soft paper, leaving the
lines of the engraving. These may now be coloured
over, with even very little skill and care. A very
good effect may be produced, so that a very indifferent
artist can in this way produce very tolerable pictures.
Then, to better preserve this, double it with
the other pane.</p>

<p>By painting and shading also on this <i>second</i> pane, as
I have discovered, very beautiful and striking effects
of light and shade can be developed, so that this
forms, as it were, a new art by itself. This will remind
the reader of the porcelain lamp-shades, which
so much resemble pictures in Indian ink; but the
effects of the double panes are more singular and far
more varied. There may be even a third pane employed.
As the materials for this art are far from expensive,
and as it is extremely easy, I have no doubt
that it will be extensively practised. Protecting one
glass picture by another is not a new art; but I am
not aware that the obtaining a series of lights by thus
reduplicating the panes has been practised.</p>

<p>A modification of it is as follows:&mdash;Cut out several
panes, corresponding to the size of the two glass
covers, of quite transparent paper or parchment, prepared
by rubbing with oil or vaseline, lard, or the
like. Paint on these the required modifications of
the picture. The advantage of this is, that a great
many shades can thus be given in a thinner space,
creating an astonishing effect. As this is not at all a
mere imitation of stained glass, and as it produces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
effects not to be found in the latter, it may rank as an
art by itself. The chief of these effects is <i>relief</i>, especially
shown in the human figure. But the most extraordinary
are the variations of chiaroscuro which
it affords, by availing himself of which the artist may
create or obtain striking suggestions for oil or <i>aquarelle</i>
pictures; for these transparencies can be so infinitely
and ingeniously varied that no one can fail to derive
from them many ideas.</p>

<p>This may be tested by simply preparing any picture,
say of a statue, a castle on a rock, or a face.
Cut out from sheets of the same size in very transparent
paper a series of shadows adapted to it, and adjust
them. They may be all in monochrome or one
colour, or in many hues. They may range, with
proper care, from almost imperceptible shadow to
opaque black. By beginning with only two stencils
or shaded pictures&mdash;for as regards these the artist
must be guided by his own skill&mdash;and gradually increasing
the number, the proper adjustment will soon
be found. I advise the beginner in copying to
proceed from monochrome to two colours before
attempting many. Teachers in <i>aquarelle</i> will find
that such copies are&mdash;after a certain degree of proficiency
shall have been obtained&mdash;much superior
to those commonly used, as they come nearer to
nature.</p>

<p>The most perfect form of this curious art is an improvement
which, I believe, is my own invention.
This consists of introducing leaves of painted <i>mica</i>
between the two glasses. In this way four grades or
tones of colour and light and shade can be made in a
picture. Mica-leaves can be made into one by using
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
mastic cement. Rub the edges with emery-paper to
roughen them.</p>

<p>As I have already intimated, the materials for this
work are so cheap and the process so easy, that all
which I here assert may be at once verified by the outlay
of a few shillings, with a few hours of time. It
is, in another form, the same thing as arranging lights
around a statue in a dark room, but adapted to all
kinds of pictures.</p>

<p>As a Latin poet has declared, “It is an easy thing
to add to arts,” when a beginning has once been
made (“<i>Inventis facile semper aliquid addere</i>”), so I will
add to this a curious discovery in glass made by me
in Venice a few years ago. I was being taken by Sir
<span class="smcap">Austin Layard</span> over his celebrated glass-factory. It
was he who, with the aid of Sir <span class="smcap">William Drake</span>, <i>first</i>
revived the almost forgotten manufacture of glass in
Murano. While standing with him by a furnace
watching a workman skilfully forming ornaments in
glass, it suddenly occurred to me that the Chinese
were said to have possessed in remote times an art,
now lost, of making vases or bottles which appeared
externally to be quite plain, but on the surface of
which, when red wine was poured in, patterns or inscriptions
appeared of the same colour. It at once
occurred to me that this could be perfectly effected by
making a bottle, on the interior of which the ground
should be of considerable thickness, say half-an-inch,
while the inscription or pattern would be no thicker
than ordinary window-glass. Then if the whole exterior
were to be lightly ground on a wheel or sandpapered,
the difference between ground and pattern
would not be perceptible until red wine or some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
highly coloured fluid were poured in, when the pattern
would at once show itself.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="smcap">Austin Layard</span> was so much struck by the
suggestion that he sent at once for his foreman, Signore
Castellani, who said that he had heard of such
bottles, but always supposed it was a fable. He,
however, at once admitted that they could be made
as I proposed, but added that the expense would be
so great as to render the invention practically useless.</p>

<p>It has, however, since occurred to me that such
bottles could be made, and cheaply, as follows:&mdash;Take
a Florence flask, and divide it into two parts
with a diamond, using a saw for the bottom. Then
on the sides within place the ground. It could be
made of silicate of soda and powdered glass or flint,
or even of white wax, hardened with powdered glass.
Close the bottle with silicate, and grind the whole.</p>

<p>When any glass has been broken and mended, the
fracture still discernible may be thus concealed by
grinding the surface, and in many cases by surrounding
it with a ring or tube of metal, also by one of silicate,
or with an ornament formed with it.</p>

<p>A glass stopper when too large can be easily filed
down to fit. Should the neck of the bottle be too
narrow, it can also be enlarged by the same process.
When the rim of a goblet is fractured, it can be ground
down on a grindstone. I have done it with a file.</p>

<p>A pane of glass can be somewhat rudely cut into
shape with a pair of strong scissors, under water. In
this, as in other things, practice leads to perfection.</p>

<p>An old method of effectually closing bottles of wine
was as follows:&mdash;The edge of the opening on the top
was ground down on a stone, and a small disc of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
glass was exactly fitted to it. Heat was then applied
till both were in partial fusion and the cover was
welded to the bottle. A little powdered glass would
aid the fusion, or it could be effected with silicate
without heating. The process is the same as using
glass stoppers, rather sunk in, and sealing up with
silicate.</p>

<p>A broken champagne bottle is not easily mended,
but I have seen one curiously utilised. The bottom
only had been broken, and it was cut off round and
evenly with a file. Within it there hung from the
cork by a cord a very large nail or small bolt of iron.
Thus prepared, it made a capital and appropriate
dinner-bell. Here in Italy I have often seen bells
made of crockery or terra-cotta; their tone is better
than would be supposed.

<span class="large">IN MENDING AND MAKING MANY OBJECTS</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>In human industry, there is on an average a loss
of fifty per cent. in labour or material.</i>”&mdash;Observations
on Art, by <span class="smcap">Charles G. Leland</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no country in the world in which the art of
mending is so much required as in the United States
of North America. The reason for this is the extraordinary
and sudden changes in temperature, causing
the expansion and contraction of cells and fibre,
especially in wood, which results in cracks. Thus
seasoned furniture and carvings, which have remained
unchanged for centuries, it may be for a thousand
years, in any part of Europe, shrink and split very
often within a month after being placed in a drawing
or dining room in Boston or Philadelphia, as I know
by sad experience. Thus I have known a very beautiful
Italian mandoline, three hundred years old, richly
inlaid with ivory, to so shrink and warp in America
that a professional mender declared that nothing
could be done with it. The sounding-board had
curled up like a scroll and split, and the mosaic or
inlaying had fallen out in bits.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i_051" src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Patterns cut from Wood-Shavings.</i></p></div>

<p>In such a case, carefully detach the warped piece or
pieces, and dampen the concave side carefully with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
sponge till it resumes its flatness or usual form.
When this is attained, take very thin shavings of a
firm wood, as thin as they can be shaved, and glue
them transversely, or <i>grain across grain</i>, to the under
or plain side of the board. This will probably prevent
all warping in
future, especially
if the best mastic
and fish-glue is employed.
It may
here be noted that
where the shavings
cannot be obtained,
thin parchment
or even note-paper
may be used,
and that good,
strong varnish, or
not too thin, may
be used for a binder.
There are many
cases in which
parchment or paper
are preferable
to wood in repairing,
as being less
liable to warp or
crack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wood-shavings</span>, which are as yet but little utilised
in art, have, however, before them “a great future.”
Combined with glue, or other binders, they can be
made, even under the hand-roller, into boards, which
have the advantage that they can be moulded, curved,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
or turned to suit many emergencies which would require
a great deal of saw or carving work.</p>

<p>It is not unusual to employ veneers, or very thin
sheets of wood, as a guard across the grain where
shrinking is to be apprehended, as in tablets for painting
on or panels, and it is a great pity that this very
cheap precaution is so little used. But there are very
few cases in which shavings are not as applicable,
and they have the great advantage of being obtainable
wherever there is a plane and wood.</p>

<p>Holes or defects in wood&mdash;for example, in American
shingle roofs or the clap-boarded sides of houses&mdash;can
often be more cheaply and readily repaired with shavings
and glue (into which oil is infused) than by any
other means. And it may be observed that such a
coating of shavings and glue, laid on to a new roof,
is the cheapest and most effective protector against
rain or sun or frost.</p>

<p>In certain work wood-shavings can be advantageously
combined with paper to give a solid, smooth surface
and firm body. Here the paper-paste, with or
without sawdust, is first forced into the cavities, and
the shavings superadded.</p>

<p>Shavings and glue are excellent for the temporary
repair of boats, and if the mending be <i>properly executed</i>,
it will be as durable as the original wood. It
would be an easy matter indeed to make a canoe entirely
of shavings and glue. If the hand-roller be
well used and thoroughly applied, the result will be
a very firm fabric.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_053" src="images/i_053.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Pattern to be cut out of Shavings and applied with Glue to a Panel.</i></p></div>

<p>It may be worth knowing in the wilderness, that
where a backwoodsman has a <i>plane</i> (and he can always
make one if he has a chisel, which, again, can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
made out of a
knife-blade) he
can make shavings,
and with
these and some
kind of <i>binder</i>&mdash;even
clay&mdash;he
can lay a
dry, hard floor,
when perhaps
boards are not
to be obtained.
The substratum
may be of
beaten clay or
stone. If of sufficient
thickness
and well
rolled, such a
floor as this
would be impervious
to
damp.</p>

<p>Any surface
can be very
well <i>veneered</i>
with shavings
and glue.
Smooth the
surface by
pressure or
rolling, and
when dry glass-paper
it. Veneers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
are often not to be had; shavings may be got
in every carpenter’s shop.</p>

<p>Not only very strong and elastic canes, but even
<i>bows</i> of a superior quality, can be made of shavings.
The Indians in Pacific America make the latter by
pasting and pressing one shaving on another with
great care. It may be understood that where the
grain, as in a piece of wood, runs <i>altogether</i> in one
way, it will split with the grain. But where it is not
uniform or connected, and is very powerfully incorporated
by pressure with a good binder, we may
easily have a very elastic and tough fabric, not so
likely to split as wood. Thus we can make from
hickory shavings a wood less liable to warp or split
than the original wood itself.</p>

<p>Wood-shavings and glue are admirably adapted to
repair broken boxes or any other articles of wood,
especially for smoothing over roughly mended surfaces
and covering knot-holes or other defects. In
all cases when possible use the roller, and when pasting
one piece on the other cross the grains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Musical instruments</span>, such as guitars, violins, and
mandolins, are very easily repaired with shavings and
glue; and this is, indeed, in many cases, the very best
means of reparation, since, while a piece of wood may
or may not injure the tone, the shavings always give
a good vibration. And where it is quite beyond the
power of any ordinary amateur, say a lady, to set in
a piece of wood or apply one, or to get it of a proper
thickness, anybody with care can paste on thin shavings&mdash;the
thinner the better&mdash;till the defect is repaired.
In many cases parchment or paper will answer
just as well, and I have myself thus perfectly mended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
violins which were apparently beyond all bettering,
and got to the stage of <i>lasciate ogni speranza</i>, or hopelessness.</p>

<p>There are, however, many cases of badly fractured
objects in which the owner gives up hope, because it
seems <i>impossible to make a beginning</i>. Now, “whatever
can be made can be mended” is true of everything
except morals, and even in these there is more to be
done than men wot of. And in a great number of
these cases parchment strips, thin linen tape, or especially
wood-shavings, can be used with success.
Bring the broken edges together if they warp apart,
and attach them with the strip and strongest cement;
that is, with small pieces of the “fastener.” Do not
attempt to do everything at once. When the edges
are united and the <i>binder</i> dried, fill in all crevices or
holes with a suitable paste or “filler”&mdash;not too much
at once, in certain cases. Then, as will generally be
required, cover the surface with thin shavings and
binder; as it dries, file or glass-paper it smooth.
The shavings will make, with mastic and fish-glue, in
many cases, a far better repair than could be effected
with a piece of wood or parchment, because they will
never <i>split</i>, like the former, if they are applied lying
transversely or crossways, nor stretch like the latter.</p>

<p>It may depend, in many cases, on what <i>wood</i> the
shavings consist of. As I have observed, even in the
bush a plane can be made with a chisel or a piece of a
table-knife blade, set in a wooden block; but elsewhere
any carpenter will easily supply what is wanted,
<i>ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>The paste or filler of wood-powder or paper-pulp
will be found described in other chapters.

<h3>ORNAMENTAL WORK OF SHAVINGS&mdash;MARQUETRY</h3>

<p><i>A curious kind of ornament</i> can be made by cutting
out decorative patterns, human figures, animals,
flowers, &amp;c., from shavings with scissors or pen-knives,
then glueing them on a smooth soft board.
Apply as much pressure as possible, so as to make
them sink into the wood, and when dry coat the
whole with varnish, till an even surface is established.
Rub over the dried surface with finest glass or emery-paper,
and then smooth patiently with the palm of
the hand. If this be well executed the result will be
a perfect imitation of inlaid wood, although it is really
an art by itself, which, I believe, is my own invention.
Thin veneers may also be used instead of shavings.
Ebony or walnut thus <i>appliqué</i> on <i>larch</i> or <i>holly</i> make
exquisite work.</p>

<p>This kind of ornament has great advantage over
inlaid wood or marquetry, for the pieces of which it
consist are far less liable to be detached or peel off,
while it looks quite as beautiful. And be it observed
that, laid with a transverse grain, it prevents warping
and strengthens the ground, while inlaying weakens
it; for to make the bed for inlaying or mosaic we
must excavate the bed till it is extremely thin and
liable to warp, whereas in shaving-work we make a
light but very strengthening addition.</p>

<p>A single experiment will suffice to convince the
reader of the merits of this very useful, elegant, and
novel art. It is specially applicable to ornamenting
albums and book-covers, where it may be used even
on pasteboard.

<h3>REPAIRING PANEL PICTURES WITH
SHAVINGS</h3>

<p>It is often a very difficult matter to obtain a thin
panel or strips and do all the work properly when we
wish to put into shape a warped panel, let us say of
an old picture, which is on the point of splitting.
The inserting screws is very dangerous. I myself
have inadvertently thus made a fearful blemish in a
Madonna’s face. But if we use <i>shavings</i> there is no
such danger. Wet the back till the panel is flat, and
then <i>gradually</i> glue on the shavings across the grain.
This is as well done with small bits as large. With
a picture it would be well to continue the coating to
the thickness of one-third of an inch or more, but a
very thin coating will go far to prevent warping or
bending. The thinnest panels or veneers may be
thus “backed up” into solid boards. In all cases
where practicable, use heavy pressure on the roller.

<h2 id="REPAIRING_WOODWORK">REPAIRING WOODWORK</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>Among the thousand mad schemes which were
proposed by projectors was one for making sawdust
into boards.</i>”&mdash;History of the South Sea
Bubble.</p></blockquote>

<p>Very few people, even among workmen and artists,
are aware of what remarkable and curious restoration
the most decayed pieces of wood are capable. We
will, however, begin with the simplest repairing, or
that of furniture.</p>

<p>When articles of furniture have been strongly and
properly made of oak or other hard wood, and as
properly used, they will last for centuries; and should
some unforeseen accident take away legs or arms,
they can be perfectly replaced, especially in the admirable
old-fashioned German objects of the kind,
which were all put together with wooden pins or by
means of mortise and tenon, so that, when need required,
they could be packed as boards;&mdash;nor were they
the less elegant for this. But if furniture be simply
sawed from soft, cheap deal or poplar, and merely
glued together (as most cheap furniture made in England
is), it will soon warp and break up, and all the
mending in the world will not make it better than it
was when new. Glue is, therefore, the great material
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
for most woodwork, and, as I shall show, in two
very different forms.</p>

<p>Having a broken chair-leg, which can, however, be
fitted together, first prepare your glue in a proper
kettle&mdash;that is, a <i>balneum mariæ</i>, or one kettle in another.
In the outer is only boiling water; in the
inner the glue, mixed with water. The reason for
this is, that glue, when softened with water, dries up
very rapidly under the action of air or fire, while the
softer heat of water keeps it, so to speak, “alive.”</p>

<p>But if, while the glue is soft, we pour, say, a
teaspoonful of nitric acid into half-a-pint of glue, it
will remain soft a much longer time&mdash;which is a valuable
secret to many, especially where large, broad
surfaces of veneers are to be glued on, and where,
the process being slow, it is desirable for the adhesive
to remain soft for many minutes. And here I would
mention that the acid-glue will remain in a liquid
state for one year if tightly corked up in a bottle. Its
only defect is a disagreeable, pungent smell.</p>

<p>This glue can be improved by being made as follows:&mdash;Take
of best glue three parts, place them in
eight parts of water, and allow the mixture to soak
some hours. Take half a part of hydrochloric or
muriatic acid and three-quarters of a part of sulphate
of zinc; add to these the glue, and keep the whole at
a moderately high temperature till fluid&mdash;that is to
say, boil the glue as usual in a <i>balneum mariæ</i> or in
hot water, after soaking it all night in water. Then
stir in the hydrochloric (or muriatic) acid and sulphate
of zinc. This is a first-class glue. Keep it in
a bottle with an oiled cork; any other stopper would
adhere. But for all ordinary work the glue, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
nitric acid, will suffice, as it holds with great tenacity
to anything.</p>

<p>This glue, which keeps liquid for a long time, and
which holds without scaling off, as common glue often
does, may also be made with <i>very strong</i> vinegar. The
latter, in fact, amounts to the same thing in most
European countries, but especially in the United
States, where, according to the New York <i>Tribune</i>,
there is literally no vinegar sold or made, save from
sulphuric acid and water. Perhaps when mankind
shall have reached a higher stage of civilisation, all
dealers will be compelled by law to place on every
article of food sold the list of ingredients of which it
is composed. We should then know how much oleomargarine
passes for butter, and what proportion of
“delicious conserves” are manufactured from apples
alone or turnips.</p>

<p>Observe that in glueing ordinary wood together the
two pieces to be attached should be gradually but
very well <i>heated</i> first. This renders them more inclined
to “take” the glue. This is applicable to
other substances.</p>

<p>Also note that when two surfaces have been made
to adhere with ordinary water-glue, should they come
apart when cold, it is very difficult to make them
unite again. But this is not the case with acid-glue.
And if you have such surfaces which will not unite,
wash them with nitric acid or very strong vinegar,
and the glue then applied will “take.” Also observe
that the acid-glue is far stronger than the common
kind.</p>

<p>Having the broken leg fitted, first with a narrow
gimlet or brad-awl make a hole crossing the fracture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
then glue the pieces together, and before the glue
dries put a screw or two through the hole; <i>i.e.</i>, <i>screw</i>
the pieces together. This will hold perfectly, if you
will sink the head of the screw in the wood, smooth
it with a file, then putty it over and paint it.</p>

<p>It seems strange that anything can be so mended as
to be stronger than before; yet this is literally true as
regards the broken leg of a chair, a cane, a beam, the
mast or spar of a vessel, or any similar long piece of
wood. This is effected as follows:&mdash;Cut the two
separated pieces into two exactly fitting “steps” or
mortises, as shown in this illustration.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="i_061a" src="images/i_061a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Fasten these with glue and screws; or, better still,
by adding to both two sliding, tightly fitting ring-tubes,
or one long one. This will actually make the
stick stronger than it was at first. The rings should
be covered with paper, glued, and then painted and
varnished.</p>

<p>The processes of glueing and screwing are applicable
to most fractures of furniture. Where a piece of
wood is broken away, it, or a similar piece, must be
inserted. When wood is warped it may be straightened
by applying wet towels. Observe that if a flat
panel is warped thus&mdash;<br />

<span class="center"><img id="i_061b" src="images/i_061b.jpg" alt="" /></span><br />

you must wet the upper or concave side, put it under
heavy weight, and as soon as it becomes straight,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
screw it down with transverse strips. Drawers which
are made from badly seasoned wood are a grief to the
heart. They warp and stick. When you find that
such is the case you can save yourself much annoyance
by examining them, planing away the obstructions,
and nailing transverse strips of wood across;
that is to say, pieces in which <i>the grain</i> of the strip
crosses that of the wood. Very good and well-seasoned
English furniture often warps badly in India;
therefore it should be thus protected. This can in
most cases be better done with strips of metal. In
large wardrobes, presses, or chests, where there are
broad and often thin panels, this precaution should
always be taken. As I write I have just seen two exquisitely
painted and valuable pictures on panel, one
of which had curved and split in two, while the other
was badly warped for want of such a precaution,
which would have cost only a penny’s worth of strip
and screws and half-an-hour’s work to save them.</p>

<p>It will very often happen in mending furniture that
neither nail, glue, nor screw can be relied on. In
such case bore with a suitable gimlet and pass wire
through the hole. Flexible wire twisted in two
strands, with the ends properly secured, say to the
head of a screw, all being sunk beneath the level, will
hold almost anything.</p>

<p>Frames for looking-glasses or pictures often
“spring” at the joints. In such cases a screw with
acidulated glue will make them permanently strong.</p>

<p>Always put handles to drawers. The vile invention
or device of using the key for a handle is by far too
common. Metallic handles of brass are preferable to
wooden knobs. Keys are often lost, or else break.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
The bottom of a drawer should always be secured by
screws.</p>

<p>When the bottom of a drawer, as frequently happens,
shrinks and becomes too short, so that there is
a long opening, the latter should be filled with a strip
of wood. The chief cause why modern furniture is
apt to become loose or separate is chiefly due to its
being made either of unseasoned or soft wood, such
as weak deal or poplar, which absorbs moisture from
the air and then dries and shrinks, or because it is
made of too many pieces only glued together, and
that with cheap, bad glue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Restoring Decayed Wood.</span>&mdash;The worst cases of
decay or of worm-eaten wood can be perfectly restored
in this manner:&mdash;Take fine sawdust of the
same kind of wood as the original. Let it be as fine
as possible, either cut with a refined saw or powdered
in a mortar. Sift it. Then with acidulated glue, or
else plain, clear, white Salisbury glue for light wood,
make a paste, well mixed. With this you can fill up
holes (using a spatula or flexible knife or ivory paper-knife).
But, what is more, you can thus make a very
strong <i>artificial wood</i> which can be moulded into any
form, and when dry polished by cutting over the surface
with a chisel or flat gouge, and using a file or
glass-paper to finish. In fact, you can mould or
model figures with this wood-paste by itself. Putty
is generally used for such repairs, but the wood-paste
is like wood, and quite as durable.</p>

<p>If you have a mould of plaster of Paris, boil it in
oil, clean it, and then oil it. With the wood-paste
you can make ornaments which can be applied to
plain wood surfaces.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>Splints, fractures, cracks, holes, corners broken
away, are all easily restored with wood-paste. In
moulding it the fingers should be oiled to prevent its
sticking.</p>

<p>Any kind of dry sawdust can thus be converted into
a paste, which, when dry, becomes wood. It may be
very much hardened under a hydraulic-press or by a
wooden hand-roller. Housekeepers should use this
composition for filling up rat-holes, or any kind of
crevices in furniture, or panels, or doors and walls,
especially where such cracks harbour insects.</p>

<p>It would be perfectly possible to construct an entire
house of such wood-cement, and one which would be
perfectly durable, or even more so than wood, since
beams and planks thus made never crack, split, nor
warp. With it the boldest vaulting and arch work
can be more easily made than in stone or with wood,
as the latter is usually worked. As builders in Turkey
form domes by making circles of clay or mud, and
gradually add to the first a smaller one, so by using
wood-paste the largest space could be covered or domed
over without building a scaffolding. There are many
places in the world where (as in the prairies of America,
Russia, and Hungary) large timber is wanting,
but where small wood for sawdust is more available,
and yet where, as cattle abound, glue would be very
cheap. This material deserves more serious attention
than it has ever received.</p>

<p>More than twenty years after I had invented, or at
least projected and put in practice, this method of
making artificial wood, I found the following in the
<i>Manuel Général du Modelage</i>, par F. Goupil; Paris,
Le Bailly:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span></p>

<p>“To make vases, take fine dry sawdust and pass it
through a sieve. It may be made into a paste with a
compound of turpentine, resin, and wax. Or mix the
adhesive with five parts of best strong white glue
(<i>colle de Flandre</i>) to one part of fish-glue. Melt them
separately, ... pour them together, boil to a proper
consistency, and mix with the sawdust. By this process
figures can be cast which, when finished by hand,
exactly resemble carved wood.”</p>

<p>Another recipe is to take 750 grammes of strong glue
to 1½ kilogramme of gall nuts. To be mixed cold.
Mix in hot water with sawdust.</p>

<p>Since writing the foregoing I have found the following
recipe in a MS. of 1780, a family heirloom
kindly lent me by Miss Roma Lister:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>To cast Wood in Moulds as fine as Ivory, of a fragrant
Smell, and indifferent Colours.</i>&mdash;Dry Lime Tree
wood sawdust in a pan by a gentle fire, and beat it to
a fine powder in a stone mortar. Sift it through
Cambric, and keep it in a dry place free from dust.
Then add to an equal quantity of Gum Tragacanth
and Gum Arabic 4 times the quantity of Parchment
Glue. Boil them in Pump Water, and filter through
Linen. Stir into it the Wood powder till it becomes
of the substance of a thick pastry; stir it all together,
and set it in a glazed pan in hot sand, for the moisture
to evaporate till it be fit for casting. Mix your
colours with the Paste, and to give it a Scent put Oil
of Cloves or Roses or the like, which, if you please,
you may mix with powdered Amber. Anoint the
mould with Oil of Almonds, and put your paste into
it. Let it dry for 4 or 5 days, then take off your
mould, and the Images will be as hard as Ivory. You
may cut, turn, carve, and plane this wood, and it will
have a fine scent. The mould may be Plaster of
Paris, but it were better made of metal.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>I would add to this, that where heavy pressure or
hand-rolling can be applied this becomes really hard.
Also note that any light, dry wood of fine texture can
be dried and powdered for this purpose. The paste,
even with common fine glue, can be used for very fine
repairing. By sifting and pulverising, the dust may
be made as fine as flour. A little calcined and powdered
glass adds to its strength.</p>

<p>To make <i>panels</i> for furniture, walls, or boxes, take
firstly a thin panel of seasoned wood, fasten two strips
of sheet-tin across the back to prevent warping, and
make or apply the cast to this. Very beautiful work
can thus be produced very cheaply.</p>

<p>It may be here observed that this principle of mixing
a powdered substance with glue or gum or an
adhesive runs through all the arts of mending. The
powder of cocoa-nut shells, slate, of paper, plaster of
Paris, of leather, clay, lime, fine sand, and many
other substances, can all be combined with adhesives,
acids, or chemical solvents in such a manner as to
form what may be called generically <i>cements</i>, or substances,
or <i>pastes</i>, which become hard. Any glue or
gum, or liquid which will make two surfaces adhere,
can be mixed with most organic or inorganic hard
substances in powder so as to form a paste which,
when dry, forms a solid, hard substance, because the
grains of the powder are thereby cemented together.
Most of these yield to the action of water, but there
are a few which resist both water and fire, all of
which will be described in this work.</p>

<p>Broken ebony can be filled in cracks with a very
neat and dainty paste or cement made as follows:&mdash;Take
dried rose-leaves, or any others as soft, steep
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
them in just enough water to soften them, add of
gum-tragacanth and gum-arabic just enough to make
a paste, and sufficient ivory black to give it an ebony
colour. Macerate the whole in a mortar. In the
East a few drops of otto of roses or of geranium are
added. From this heads are made, also medallions,
or any other small objects. The composition sets
very hard, and much resembles ebony. I have made
many small objects of it myself, and can testify to its
excellence. It is in this manner that the black rosaries
from Constantinople are made.</p>

<p>A very good cement for filling cracks in furniture
or other woodwork is made as follows:&mdash;One part of
finely powdered resin and two parts of yellow wax
are melted together, and to this is added two parts
of finely pulverised ochre, or other suitable colouring
earthy substance. This is an excellent cement in all
respects, except that it yields to great heat. For all
such repairing sawdust and glue is much to be preferred.</p>

<p>In repairing furniture, remember the screws hold
much more firmly if they are just dipped in boiling
beeswax or turpentine. If you are not accustomed
to screwing or nailing, just make a hole with a brad-awl,
else you will find the screw or nail going out of
the side of the box, or in some other undesired direction.</p>

<p>Clamps, or pieces of wood connected by screws,
ties, or elastic bands, are indispensable in much glueing
pieces together. They are, however, easily made.
A good clamp can be made by bending over the two
ends of a strong piece of wire. Hammer the ends
into the wood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>Glue is more elastic when mixed with a little glycerine.
This should be borne in mind when mixing
glue with sawdust to form artificial wood, and, in
fact, in many manufactures and combinations where
it is specially desirous to have a certain degree of
toughness or flexibility in the object made.</p>

<p>To utilise waste matter is allied to mending, which
is only preventing waste. For this purpose common
wood-shavings may be used for a pretty art. Take
good shavings of any wood, and after moistening
them with glue or gum tragacanth and arabic, press
them flat. Trim them with scissors into leaves, or
make them into flowers, and attach them together.
Then pour over them liquid plaster of Paris, in
which there is gum-arabic and alum dissolved. Take
a bush, or plant without leaves, and gum the leaves
to it or to its twigs. Cover bare places with the gypsum.
When dry varnish the whole. A Professor
<span class="smcap">Heigelin</span>, in Stuttgart, once had an exhibition of
such work. Frames can be decorated in this manner.
Paint, gilding, and enamel, or bronze powders, can,
of course, be applied. Shavings combined with weak
glue submitted to pressure form artificial wood or
boards, which can be improved by further combination
with waste-paper. Made with a solution of alum
it is fireproof. Its strength will be in proportion to
the pressure applied. It can often be employed in
repairing when suitable wood is wanting, and has the
advantage that it can be turned to any shape.</p>

<p>The reader can easily satisfy himself by experiment
that these artificial woods made from sawdust or
shavings, combined with adhesives, are very easy to
manufacture, very cheap, and, when properly made,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
extremely strong. When strong pressure or rolling
can be applied, the quantity of adhesive may be
diminished. Linen or muslin rags, cotton-wool, or
any textile fabric can be added to the shavings, as
well as waste-paper of all kinds. Anything fibrous
or stringy will aid in the binding.</p>

<p>This subject may be studied in detail in a work entitled
<i>Die Verwerthung der Holtzabfälle</i>&mdash;The rendering
valuable of Refuse-Wood, such as Shavings,
Refuse Dye-Wood, &amp;c., showing how they may be
converted to Artificial Wood, Fuel, Chemicals, Explosives,
&amp;c.&mdash;by <span class="smcap">Ernst Hubbard</span>; Vienna, price 3
marks.</p>

<p>Wood of all kinds is in America sawed into such
thin veneers that they are used to serve as wall-paper,
being attached with paste. When damp they bend
like paper. Such veneer is very useful for repairing
wooden surfaces.</p>

<p>Common putty is not always to be trusted in for
repairing wood. It sometimes shrinks, and is never
very hard. The glue with glycerine and sawdust or
cocoa-nut dust is preferable.</p>

<p>“Scratches and chance cuts may be remedied by
merely melting or washing and rubbing in with cold
water. But for most small defects a <i>filler</i> is used.
This is a kind of paint or liquid cement, the object of
which is to fill up the pores of certain coarse woods
and make the surface fine. Soft wax, flour, and varnish
are used for this purpose.”</p>

<p>Any dealer in paints and varnishes will supply a
filler for any special work.</p>

<p>Staining or colouring wood is an important part of
repairing. “Oiling alone is a kind of colouring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
for all oiled wood becomes much darker in a short
time.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Soda dissolved in water gives to oak wood a much
darker tone. Dark tea and alum is also useful, and
still better very strong coffee. Also porter or beer
mixed with umber. Also a decoction of walnut-leaves
boiled down. In using these or any other colours the
following rules must be strictly observed:&mdash;(1.) Use
a sponge or brush, and do not apply the dye freely or
pour it on, as you will run great risk of warping the
wood or making it split. (2.) Exercise the greatest
care in drying it near a fire. (3.) Do not expect to
colour all at once by a profuse application. However
light the colour may seem, always when it is dry rub
off the colour with a rag or chamois-skin, and then
make a second wash. This process will make the dye
strike in deeper and last longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stevens’</span> Stains, also those of <span class="smcap">Mander</span>, are very
good and strong. They generally require dilution.</p>

<p>Ammonia is much used to give wood a dark rich
colour. Wood thus treated, if afterwards exposed to
the smoke of a wood fire, assumes a very ancient appearance.
Bichromate of potash with water is a good
dark dye, but it must be carefully handled, as it is
very poisonous and injurious to clothing. It is used
to give a waterproof quality to certain cements.</p>

<p>Good writing-ink is a very good black dye. When
it is quite dry, oil, rub, and polish it, and the ink will
resist a great deal of wetting.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that with ink, as with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
dyes, there should always be at least two applications,
and that the first should be very thoroughly dried, if
possible, in a strong light, though not in sunshine,
before the second is laid on. Three coats of blackest
ink well dried in, then rubbed in well, and finally
oiled, form an almost waterproof cover.</p>

<p>When panels of marquetry or of inlaid wood of different
colours are broken away or require to be replaced,
it can be done in the following manner:&mdash;Take
a panel of very firm fine white wood&mdash;holly is
the best; next to it Swiss or German larch&mdash;draw
on it your pattern, and then with a penknife go over
all the pattern, cutting into the panel about a quarter
of an inch, or rather less&mdash;in no case far enough to
cut through. Then carefully fill all these lines with
a firm cement, and let it dry well. Then with a dye&mdash;not
with paint&mdash;color each piece appropriately.
The cement and lines will prevent the dye from
spreading from piece to piece. This is known as
Venetian marquetry. When finished, apply <i>Soehnée</i>
varnish, and rub down very carefully by hand. It is
a very beautiful and easy work, not to be distinguished
when well done from real inlaying. Very
cheap and plain old furniture can be easily made very
elegant by having panels, &amp;c., of this work applied.
The reader may begin with a small box or three-legged
stool, working directly on the wood, and will
then probably be encouraged to proceed. Dark
brown patterns on light yellow wood look well.</p>

<p>This work is very easy and elegant, very little
made, and may be therefore profitable. Any kind of
light or white wood, such as deal or pine, may be
used for common decoration. Cheap violins and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
guitars are sometimes made into handsome ornaments
for rooms by this process. For designs for this purpose
consult the Manuals of Design, Wood-Carving,
and Leather-Work, by the Author (Whittaker &amp; Co.,
No. 2 White Hart Street, London, E.C.).</p>

<p>Marquetry may also be mended by making and colouring
wood-paste, in which case prepare the ground
with great care, by roughening, to hold the glue;
also by using coloured cements, such as bread, well
worked with powder and glycerine-glue.</p>

<p>It does not seem to occur to many people&mdash;even to
those living in the country&mdash;that there is a great deal
of strong, plain, useful furniture which can be easily
made at home at no very great expense, boards of
good quality being cheap enough. With a few lessons
from an expert, or even with the study of a good
elementary manual of cabinetmaking, any amateur
can succeed. Whoever can make a good box can
make an antique chair, and this can, however plain,
be carved, stained, or marquetried into beauty; but
let him beware of sawed curves.</p>

<p>Where there are worms in furniture or other wood,
they should always be very promptly exterminated,
else they will destroy it in time. To remove them,
dissolve 2 drachms of corrosive sublimate in 2 oz. of
methylated spirit and 2 oz. of water, to be applied
freely with a feather or brush. This is an unfailing
remedy; but the mixture is poisonous, and therefore
should be kept labelled out of harm’s way (<i>Work</i>,
Sept. 1892).</p>

<p>In restoring or repairing woodwork we must have
some knowledge not only of paints, varnishes, putties,
and filling, but also of agents which prevent organic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
change or are applicable to peculiar accidents. One
of the principal of these is known as <i>knotting</i>. Its
properties and general nature are freely explained in
the following article from <i>The Decorator</i>, Sept. 1892:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“‘Knotting,’ or, as it is usually written, <i>Patent
Knotting</i>, is a quick-drying, semi-transparent fluid.
It is made from naphtha and shellac; hence its quick-drying
nature. The knots of woodwork, especially
pine, contain much resin, which gradually exudes
from the surface. This resin will speedily darken,
and ultimately destroy, the covering film of oil paint
with which woodwork is usually coated. The object
of coating knots in woodwork with ‘patent knotting
composition’ is to seal up, so to term it, the resin.
In the earlier history of house-painting processes a
mixture of red lead and strong glue-size, applied
warm, was often used. The chief point in view is to
stop the ‘cause,’ but without objectionable ‘effect;’
therefore the thinnest perceptible covering&mdash;so long
as it is effectual&mdash;is the best. The <i>patent knotting</i> of
commerce is the article now generally purchased and
used. The knots are given one or two <i>bare</i> coatings&mdash;according
to the nature of the knot, and the conscience
of the workman. The best knotting is the
colour of dark oak varnish; the worst is the blackest
and dirtiest-looking. It always pays to have the best
knotting, since ‘black knotting’ requires an extra
coat of paint to cover the dark patches which ‘grin
through’ any light tints. For the best work it is
usually advisable&mdash;especially when the woodwork has
to be finished, and perhaps hand-polished, in ‘ivory-white’
enamel&mdash;to have the knots cut out with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
chisel or gouge, then fill up with lead ‘filling-up’ in
distemper. I recently had to have the door of an
elaborately decorated drawing-room so treated, since,
despite being fresh knotted, the resin began to discolour
the work, which had received some six coats
of paint and enamel, ere the room was furnished&mdash;a
very annoying and costly matter. Very occasionally
knots are gilded over with best gold-leaf; this is generally
conceded to be an effectual plan to adopt, when
gouging is not resorted to, for finest work. Knotting
woodwork is, therefore, not an insignificant detail of
house-painting, especially when we are dealing with
a door-side; that alone, when finished in hand-polished
enamel, may cost a ten-pound note to produce.
‘Tin-paint’ will do for common priming; good linseed
oil is the chief element required. All new woodwork
requires three coats of good lead and oil paint
before standing any time&mdash;viz., priming and two after-coats.
This is known as ‘builders’ finish.’ When
permanently decorated it usually requires ‘getting
up’ to a proper surface, and two or three more coats.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is sometimes an advantage to “gouge”&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to
cut&mdash;out a bad knot and fill the cavity with wood,
wood-paste, or <i>carton-pierre</i>.</p>

<p>A very beautiful stain can be given to wood by rubbing
it with nitric or sulphuric acid, and exposing it
to the heat of a fire. In this way American hickory
can be made to look like rosewood. Pine becomes
red, which grows darker with increased heat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mending Furniture.</span>&mdash;There is but one rule for
repairing creaky chairs and tables with loose legs.
They must be <i>carefully</i> taken apart, which can be done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
with chisels, a knife, and hammer, and then glued
and screwed or put together again as they were originally
made. The old-fashioned rounds or rungs of
chairs, now so seldom seen, were a great aid to
strength and durability.</p>

<p>I have already remarked that when a drawer in a
bureau table is troublesome by continually sticking
or catching, take it out, find where it rubs, and plane
away the obtrusive portion. If it is made of badly
seasoned, green, warping wood, nail across it strips
of tin. To which I add that doors of closets, cabinets,
&amp;c., which are shrunk must have strips of wood
glued to their edges. In some cases strips of paper
will do as a temporary substitute.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration whatever to declare that two
or three centuries ago the slight and trashily made
article of furniture was a great exception, while at the
present day it is the well-made, durable article which
forms the rarity&mdash;to the great shame, be it said, firstly,
of all furniture-makers, and, secondly, to fashionable
“taste,” which prefers slightness to strength.</p>

<p>This trashy and flimsy lightness is vastly to the
profit of the cabinetmaker, since he can thus utilise
the cheapest and smallest pieces of worthless wood
by turning them into supports for light <i>étagères</i> or
shelves, cross-backs and legs of spider-like little
chairs, and all parts of small curved sofas, which are to
be duly puttied, French polished, or completely hidden
in velveteen or rep. It is not unusual to see what is considered
a handsomely furnished room in which there
is not one absolutely well-made or strong article
which would bear careful examination or turning up.
It is a pitiful sight indeed to see a load of such furniture
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
on its way from the cabinetmakers, or the mill
where it is sawed out by steam, to the place where it
is to be veneered or painted, glazed, and clothed into
elegance. The pieces of refuse pine wood and American
greenish-yellow poplar stuck together with glue,
and as few short nails as possible, look so shammy
and shabby! I have wondered, in beholding them,
at the marvellous boldness of their makers, who could
deliberately calculate the time that such stuff would
endure before its <i>débacle</i>. And as it is all destined to
be broken and mended sometime or other, it is the
more necessary that the art of repairing should be
studied. Unfortunately, badly seasoned deal cannot
be repaired into well-seasoned oak. Yet he who will
take the pains to ascertain the price of the latter will
be amazed to learn that so few people have it made
into good, solid, strong furniture. “It is not <i>there</i>
that the expense comes in.” If the reader, having
some sense or taste in art, would make his own furniture,
employing an assistant at six shillings a day to
do the rough sawing and planing, he would find that
he could have strong, substantial furniture; and if
he would add to this so much knowledge of panel-carving
as he could acquire in a few lessons, he might
make it beautiful.</p>

<p>While the glue is soft stir into it the wood-ashes in
greater or lesser quantity, according to their quality
and fineness, till a syrupy mass is formed. Clay can
also be combined with this mixture to make casts.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<p>Common <i>peat</i> of fine quality (for there are different
kinds or degrees of it), carefully cleaned from sticks
and fibres, combined with common glue infused freely
with nitric acid, submitted to strong pressure, is said
to form a valuable substitute for wood, which may be
used not only for repairing, filling chinks in trees,
making up decayed timber, &amp;c., but also to form
blocks and planks.</p>

<p>I have elsewhere mentioned that shavings are utilised
in Germany. Combined with glue, infused with
glycerine, and submitted to pressure, they form
boards which are even less brittle than many which
are in ordinary use. The peculiar advantage of this
artificial timber is the limitless length of the boards
which can be thus made, which is often a great desideratum
in flooring, or indeed in any building where
piecing should be avoided. A canoe can thus be
made on another as mould, in which case the shaving-cement
is to be hardened by rollers. There is a
book on this subject, elsewhere mentioned.</p>

<p>It may be observed that, as long and broad timber
becomes every year more rare and valuable, artificial
timber from smaller plants must certainly take its
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whitewash for wood</span> is rendered more durable
and glossy by the addition of liquid glue, well stirred
in. It is still further improved by the addition of
milk. This lasts so much longer than common wash
that it is in the end perhaps ten times as cheap.
When well made it has been known, when applied to
the exterior of certain Government buildings in Washington,
U.S.A., to last for seven years. If colouring
matter, such as umber, be added, let the latter be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
mixed separately with the glue, and very thoroughly,
before it is joined to the lime. The addition of a few
eggs to the mixture will improve it. The lime prepared
with the following forms a still better and
stronger wash, which is well worth the extra expense:&mdash;</p>

glue, and it is to be used at once. This is (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>)
useful to coat and caulk casks, especially those in
which such fluids as highly rectified spirits of wine
are carried. Be it observed that the hotter the mixture
is when applied the more deeply does it penetrate,

for this purpose <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> gives the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take the finest sawdust and combine it with linseed-oil
varnish, kneading the mass very carefully.”</p>

<p>This, when properly combined and worked, would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
form a very good artificial wood. It may be here observed,
that because the experimenter finds at a first
trial that the wood is too brittle or too hard, he is not
to conclude that the <i>recipe</i> is good for nothing. Thus,
to prepare it with, glue we should take&mdash;</p>

<p>First boil the glue very carefully, and stir into it
the finest wood-dust or cocoa-nut shell powder. The
quality will be improved if the latter has already been
steeped for some time in a strong solution of oak-bark
or gall-apples in spirit, or, instead of the latter, water.
This disposes the dust to amalgamate with the glue.
Stir the whole thoroughly. A commoner or coarser
preparation for simply repairing is made by combining
plaster of Paris, glue in watery solution, and sawdust.
Common bone-dust, plaster of Paris, and glue
make a good cement for light wood-dust. With a
little glycerine it can be used for moulding. Add a
little pipeclay, and if the bone-dust be very fine the
surface will take a very high polish. Finish with oil
and hand rubbing. This composition combines well
with perfectly softened and macerated paper&mdash;not
merely <i>soaked</i>&mdash;to form panels, which, however, to
make them hard, should be pressed or rolled.</p>

<p>The resin is first melted, the turpentine then stirred

<p>I have spoken of artificial wood as chiefly made of
sawdust combined with a binder such as glue. There
are, however, strictly speaking, other kinds. The
first of these is made from <i>cellulose</i>, which is disintegrated
wood which still retains its fibre. It was discovered,
I believe, by accident, in New York about
thirty years ago. A stick, which fitted tightly, had
been left in a cannon, when the latter was fired off.
The result was that the stick was converted into a
pulpy, fibrous mass, which was found to be admirable
as a material for making paper. This, combined with
glue, makes good boards.</p>

<p>Bark of different kinds is also combined in powder
with glue to make wood. In all of these mixtures,
where it is desirable to avoid brittleness or hardness,
there must be an admixture of oil or glycerine.
There is generally about 20/100 of the latter to 80/100 of
sawdust, but the proportion varies according to the
degree of elasticity or hardness required. To make
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
boards the mixture is passed under heavy rollers, and
when dry it is further treated with alum in solution,
or tanner’s infusion of oak-bark, to make it waterproof.
This is not necessary for ordinary work or
repair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To prepare Wood for Paint.</span>&mdash;When you have a
board or box, &amp;c., however rough, and of any kind
of inferior wood, first smooth the surface, if possible
by planing, or else with a rasp and glass-paper. Fill
all the holes and chinks with putty, or bread and
gum, or gum and plaster of Paris. Then, with a mixture
of glue (not too stiff) and fine white plaster of
Paris, rub over all the surface to perfect smoothness,
and when quite dry remove any irregularities with
finest glass-paper. Then paint as desired. This is
an approved method of repairing old panel pictures,
which were all made with such a ground of plaster
and glue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To repair Marquetry or Inlaid Woodwork.</span>&mdash;This,
as I have already said, and will now describe
more in detail, is made of different pieces of coloured
wood, glued on a panel. Take a piece of fine hard
wood, such as holly, and saw it out to exactly fit the
place where pieces are missing. Draw the pattern on
it, and then outline it very neatly with a fine pen-knife-point,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
so as to cut a little way into the wood,
but not <i>through</i> it. Fill up this line thus cut with a
composition of varnish and any black powder. Then
with <i>dyes</i>, not oil paint or water-colour, but such as
are made with spirit, colour the pattern, a separate
colour to every piece. The dye will sink in and grow
pale; then apply it again, and till it is of the hue desired.
Polish the whole. This is what is called
Venetian marquetry. It is, very easy to make, and
produces beautiful results, quite equal to the sawed-out
and inlaid work. It is, moreover, much more
durable and far less expensive. <span class="smcap">Mander’s</span> dyes are
used for such staining.</p>

<p>Even a single inlaid figure of wood, set into a panel,
as in the back of a chair, gives a character, and apparently
greater value, to the whole. Such inlaying
is easily made with a fret-saw. If we take two thin
plates of wood, one dark and one light, and saw the
same pattern out of both, we can then set one into the
other, and so make two inlays by one process. <i>Parquetry</i>
is large inlaying for floors. For this it is well
to study such forms as can be <i>set together</i>, as, for instance,
squares, diamonds, crosses, <span class="t">T</span>’s and the like.</p>

<p>Violins, guitars, and lutes can be beautifully
adorned by the Venetian process. As the colours do
not wear away, and cannot scale off like common inlaying,
it will be seen that it is by far the best way to
decorate them. Furniture of all kinds can be ornamented
in the same way. It is peculiarly appropriate
to picture-frames. It being very little known, objects
thus prepared meet with a ready sale.</p>

<p>When a corner of a pane in a window, as often happens&mdash;as
also to the glass of a picture-frame or mirror&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
broken away, we can easily make or have made
a small ornament which will fit into the corner and
conceal the defect, This can be made of wood, <i>papier-mâché</i>
(which is best), or hard putty or cement. It
may be gilded or painted. Windows may be prettily
ornamented in this manner, even if not broken.</p>

tile or piece of tin under the sheet, with a hole in it,
to prevent sticking, spread the paste, which is really
soft paper, with a knife over the hole. When dry it
will be mended permanently. Observe that the pulp
must be a fine <i>paste</i>, not merely paper mixed with
paste&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, lumpy and stringy, but soft. Secondly,
that a better “binder” or size than flour-paste is one
made from scraps of parchment boiled, till all the
gelatine is extracted. Take the latter and let it boil
till thick. It makes a finely glazed surface.</p>

<p>Do not begin to do this with a book, but with a
sheet out of which holes have been punched. It is
delicate work, and you must not expect to succeed in
it at once. But in time, with care, you will remake
the paper with great skill. There are workmen who
can even reunite torn edges in this manner so that the
mending is almost imperceptible. This is remaking
paper with paper. In some cases it will suffice to
simply neatly paste a piece of paper over a torn-away
space. This may be done&mdash;as in most cases&mdash;very
clumsily, or it may be performed artistically and
daintily. In the latter case, using a very sharp and
specially <i>thin</i> bladed penknife, shave down or scrape
away the overlapping edge, and apply the paste sparingly
with the point of a camel’s-hair small brush.
Before it is quite dry lay the leaf on a smooth, hard
surface, and with the penknife or a burnisher flatten
down the thinned edge to an uniform surface. This
also requires a little practice, but when learned the
artist may effect miracles of restoration. One may,
and that not infrequently, buy for shillings books
which when mended sell for many pounds.</p>

<p>It often happens that we find some curious little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
old book which has been sadly cut or worn, almost
down to the type. Take it, and with a flat rule carefully
cut out every page, leaving just a little rim of
margin. Then having obtained old paper corresponding
to your text, or good modern hand-made Dutch,
using strong glue-paste or flour and gum-arabic, or
paper-paste, make borders, on which paste the old
pages. If you have old paper&mdash;there are dealers who
can supply it&mdash;you may do this so well that the juncture
will be hardly perceptible. In any case you will
greatly enhance the value of the book. In this, as in
all such work, never attempt to restore anything of
value till you shall have succeeded by experimenting.
This is very seldom done, and yet books thus restored
sell for a price which must make the work very profitable.
One reason, however, why we see so little of
it is the <i>extravagant</i> price charged for all such work
by the agent who supplies it.</p>

<p>The prices paid for books thus restored and mounted
are extremely high, simply because there are so
few people who know how to do it well; and yet, as
any of my readers may find, the art is an easy one,
requiring only neatness and care. There are very
few libraries where such restorers might not be employed,
to the very great profit of the collection. All
purchasers for libraries are continually rejecting books
because they are tattered and worn or “holey,” which
could be sent to the hospital and doctored into value.
And it is, indeed, to be regretted for the sake of the
public that our great libraries have not all shops attached
where duplicates and damaged rarities restored
could be sold at fair, not fancy, prices. For it
is firstly the great librarian who sees and rejects the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
most books, and who could do an immense amount
of good, and greatly stimulate an interest in collection
and literature&mdash;and make money&mdash;if he would
also facilitate acquisition. The art of restoring and
of mending is as yet so much in its infancy, and is so
little understood and practised, that there is not one
book in a thousand, even of <i>rariora</i> and <i>curiosa</i>, preserved
as it might be.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to lay some stress on the
fact that many persons, especially women, if they
will take a little pains to experiment, can easily make
a living by thus restoring books and injured documents.
There are, indeed, many other means of
earning money indicated in this work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A cheap and durable varnish</span> specially made for
bookbinders is prepared as follows:&mdash;Take coarsely
powdered gum-copal, add to it oil of thyme (<i>oleum
thymi serpilli</i>) or pure oil of rosemary (<i>oleum rosmarini</i>),
sufficient to form a solution. Pour off the superfluous
liquid, and mix the remainder with sufficient alcohol
to dissolve it well. In making take only so much of
the oil of thyme or rosemary as will cover the copal,
and of alcohol about eight or ten parts to the whole.
Special varnishes, and perhaps better, are known to
many bookbinders, who will sell them, or inform you
where to obtain them. I know of none so good as
that of <span class="smcap">Soehnée</span>, which is, however, very expensive,
costing about ninepence per ounce. It is rather brittle,
however, for pictures.</p>

<p>When a book is dog’s-eared, or its leaves have been
turned, if the paper be of a thin, poor quality, its
chances of restoration are better than if it were good
and stiff. In the former case damp the leaves one by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
one with water in which a <i>little</i> gum tragacanth has
been infused. This is not so much an adhesive as a
mere stiffener, and is used as such for laces. Then
flatten them, putting a piece of smooth white paper
between every leaf.</p>

<p>There is, I fear, nothing to be done where the
reader is so utterly devoid of all the instincts of a
gentleman or a lady as to turn over a stiff, thick,
highly glazed paper to mark the place! I have just
found this done in a magnificently illustrated work
from a circulating library, and, to aggravate the
offence, it was on pictured pages! I would here remark
that if every reader would keep by him a piece
of indiarubber or eraser, and obliterate, or at least
render illegible, all the scribblings made on margins,
this detestably vulgar practice would soon be at
an end.</p>

<p>It may be observed that to repair pages which have
been torn across, or engravings, the rent is usually
<i>transverse</i>&mdash;that is, such as to leave a small flap edge.
If we take very strong gum in very minute quantity
on the point of a camel’s-hair brush, we may often
succeed with great care in perfectly reuniting the
edges. Observe that in this, as in everything, the
mender should not draw his conclusions from the first
effort, which will probably be a failure, but from frequent
careful observation and experiment. There are
marvellously few people in the world who take the
pains to become really good menders of anything&mdash;excepting
lace and the like&mdash;hence there are few
things mended at all except by botchers and amateurs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ink-Stains</span> can be removed from paper by laying
underneath the blot a pad of clean blotting-paper or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
fine muslin. Take a fine sponge, dip it in lemon-juice,
and press it gently on the stain, so as to moisten
it. Then with a clean, white, soft rag, folded into a
pad, press on the spot, and the pad, lifted off, will remove
a little of the ink. Repeat this process a few
times, taking care to change the pad in your hand
every time <i>to a clean</i> spot. Do not try to <i>rub</i> the stain
out (as most people do), but to <i>draw</i> the ink away or
out by sucking up or by absorption. If you simply
rub or press the ink in again which has just been
drawn out, you will only make bad worse. And here
I would observe that by this process of pressing, absorbing,
and changing the “sucker” applied, you can
draw appalling stains out of almost anything. You
cannot, of course, prevent chemical action or change
of colour, but in most cases this is the best process.</p>

<p>It is better to begin with lemon-juice and a little
salt and water where the paper is thin. When it is
strong, a mixture of muriatic acid and water generally
extracts ink.</p>

<p>In a great many cases the staining fluid can be
drawn out by absorption before any chemical change
in the colour of the stuff can have been effected.
Therefore it is all-important to know how to do this
yourself <i>at once</i>, and not wait till it can be sent to a
dyer or scourer or cleaner. In a few hours’ time that
which could have been promptly extracted will be
past all cure. When you spill ink on paper, promptly
apply, first of all, blotting-paper, and then try absorption.
If any stain remains then, apply the acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To take out a Grease-Spot.</span>&mdash;Heat an iron (I generally
effect it with a burning cigar), and hold it as
near as possible to the stain without burning the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
paper. If this be well done the grease, wax, &amp;c.,
will rapidly disappear. If there are any traces left,
place on it powdered calcined magnesia for a time.
This is also a good means to extract grease, wax, or
oil from cloth. Very often, where lemon-juice or
acid would ruin the colour of a cloth or other fabric,
chloroform will take out the spot and leave the colour
unchanged.</p>

<p><i>Bone</i>, well calcined and powdered, is an excellent
absorbent of grease. It should be remembered that
all such processes must be renewed, for after the
powder or cloth applied has received a certain quantity
of the grease or stain, it ceases to be taken in.
A gentle pressure or rubbing, after laying paper over
the powder, facilitates the absorption.</p>

<p>The celebrated <span class="smcap">Athanasius Kircher</span>, who wrote in
the sixteenth century, has left an amusing account of
how he one night, stopping at a convent in Sicily,
took a book from the library (it was <span class="smcap">Stephanus
Fagundez’</span> <i>In Præcep’a Ecclesiæ</i>)&mdash;“a new book and
elegantly bound”&mdash;and spilt over it and in it all the
midnight oil from his lamp! In great alarm he sent
for quicklime, but there was none to be had. So he
bade the monks bring him some <i>bones</i>, which he
quickly calcined and pulverised and applied. And
the next morning there was not a trace of a spot, only
a little smell of oil, which soon vanished. He adds,
that plaster of Paris would have done as well.</p>

<p>Ascertain carefully the nature of the spot before
trying to extract it. For resinous substances use
spirits, or eau de cologne, or turpentine. Benzine
extracts several substances.</p>

<p>An old recipe for removing ink-stains was to take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
a spoonful of good aquafortis, in which break a piece
of chalk the size of a large barley corn; add two
spoonfuls of rose-water and one of vinegar. This
should be mixed in a clean glass and left to stand for
several hours. It is to be applied with a piece of new
sponge, by pressure, and not too freely nor too long.
When the paper is nearly dry renew the process, and
when the ink shall have disappeared, promptly wash
out the acid with pure water and a clean linen rag.
(But it is <i>too strong</i> for many fabrics.)</p>

<p>When the ink does not penetrate the paper it can
be removed by erasure with a sharp penknife, or a
preparation of vulcanised indiarubber and powdered
pumice-stone sold by most stationers. When this
latter does not “bite,” its action can be aided by very
slightly moistening it. After erasure rub the spot
scraped with very finely powdered pumice-stone, and
polish with a burnisher or any smooth substance.</p>

<p>Even when an inkstand has been spilled over a
printed or long-written page, we can by prompt action
extract the new ink and leave the old plain as ever;
but the reader who expects to work this miracle of
changing night into day must not wait till the accident
happens to first attempt to remedy it, or he will
probably fail. Let him first of all, not once but often,
pour ink on some waste and worthless page, and then
experiment first with the blotting-paper, then with
the dilute acids and the padding. The time will not
by any means be wasted.</p>

<p>A fresh ink-spot can be easily removed from paper
by rubbing it with a finely pulverised mixture of saltpetre,
sulphur, alum, and pumice. If the spot is an
old one, moisten it first a little with water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Ink-spots, &amp;c., in old MSS. were sometimes ingeniously
covered by ornaments in gold or colour.</p>

<p>When an entire page or many pages of a book are
missing, it often happens that, at much less expense
than would be supposed, an ingenious printer can restore
the whole. There are many books for which it
would be worth while to have the type cast, for even
with a page thus restored the book may be worth ten
times as much as if it were wanting. Missing pages
are often supplied by photographic fac-similes from
another copy.</p>

<p>It was only yesterday, as I write, here in Florence,
that I heard a tourist declare that there was nothing
worth buying to be found, and that everything curious
was snapped up at once. To which I could not
assent, never having seen so many objects as of late
which I regarded as great bargains. But they were
all <i>dilapidated</i>, and the tourist generally likes to see
everything in splendid condition. To him who can
restore old books and ivories and leather-work and
panel pictures, there will be no lack of bargains for a
long time anywhere. The men who sell are not all
such marvellous experts in mending up, repairing,
and forging as literary dealers in the wonderful would
have us believe. If they were so clever they would
not let valuable panel pictures split in two before their
eyes from ignorance of knowing how to straighten
and tack them at a penny’s cost. There is abundance
of clever forging, of lying ivories and silver-work and
sham antique leather, but of restoration of smaller or
of single objects there is very little; and there is, as
I have said, in this a vast field for every collector who
knows enough to make practical application of what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
is taught in this book. It is so far from true that
everything is now snapped up, that I confidently assert
that there is hardly a <i>bric-à-brac</i> shop in Europe
in which a skilled repairer cannot find a bargain, and
in most cases several.</p>

<p>It will often be of service to the mender of books
to be able to prepare parchment-paper for himself.
If we take a mixture of one part nitric acid to three
of water&mdash;the proportions varying very much with the
quality of the acid and of the paper&mdash;and dip into it
a piece of soft unglazed paper, the latter will at once
harden into a substance like parchment. It should
be at once washed in changes of pure water. I may
here observe that neither in making this nor anything
else should the operator be satisfied with a single experiment.</p>

<p>Regarding paper, there are certain curious facts
worth knowing by every reader. Before the invention
or general use of window-glass, a very transparent
kind of paper was, according to <span class="smcap">Kircher</span> (<i>De
Secretis</i>), prepared as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take paper from the mill, not as yet sized, and mix
with it to six parts of turpentine two of mastic. This
really makes a very clear, or at least diaphanous,
medium, which may be used for temporarily repairing
broken glass windows.</p>

<p>The same writer informs us that if we take fine
parchment (<i>pergamenam hædinum</i>), prepared without
lime, or naturally dried, we should lay it in water,
which will just cover it, in which has been well infused
boiled honey and the white of eggs. This was
used to repair coloured glass windows.</p>

<p>There is also given in the <i>Zauberbuch</i> of <span class="smcap">Johann</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
<span class="smcap">Wallberger</span>, Frankfort, 1760, a recipe for the same
purpose:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Take parchment prepared without lime, and steep
it in a mixture of thick gum-arabic dissolved in water,
the yolk of eggs well shaken, and clarified honey.”</p>

<p>It is worth observing, as regards these recipes from
old works, that while those founded on modern chemistry
and experiment are generally cheaper and apparently
better, the former are often more <i>durable</i> in
effect, and were, indeed, more thoroughly tested.
There were a great many parchment windows in those
days, and there are none now. And in these old
works of <span class="smcap">Porta</span>, <span class="smcap">Weckerus</span>, <span class="smcap">Tenzelius</span>, <span class="smcap">Kircher</span>,
<span class="smcap">Alexander of Piedmont</span>, <span class="smcap">Mizaldus</span>, <span class="smcap">Valentine
Krautemann</span>, and many more of which I have a large
collection, there are many curious prescriptions, many
of which I have seen revived from time to time of late
years as modern scientific inventions&mdash;on which subject
an interesting article could be written.</p>

<p>A weak solution of oxalic acid in water is often the
best to remove ink and other stains from strong white
paper or linen. It should be applied by gently pressing
or <i>dabbing</i> (not rubbing) with a cotton pad. As
soon as the stain is removed, dab it again with clean
water. Take good care, however, that there are no
scratches or cuts on your fingers, for if the acid gets
into them it will cause great pain.</p>

<p>I may here mention that the old bookbinders’ paste
was made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take a quarter of a pound of starch, steep it a
quarter of an hour in water, and stir it till it is milky.
Add a pinch of alum, and boil it once more.</p>

<p>This was said to keep better than paste made from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
flour. (Add a few drops of oil of cloves or carbolic
acid, and it will keep very well.) Flour can, however,
be used instead of starch, and a good adhesive be the
result. A little glue very much improves it. There
is a great difference in the quality of cement made
from bread, as the condition of the latter has been
changed by fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Binding.</span>&mdash;Repairing books is nearly allied to <i>binding</i>,
and the latter is, in perfection, a somewhat difficult
art. Yet it is not at all difficult for a careful
person to bind up many works in such a manner that
they will bear much reading, and with a little artistic
skill look very well. This may be effected as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>When a book is stitched together, there are sewed
into the back two or more cross pieces of string or
strips of muslin, which project a little on either side,
and which, by being pasted down inside the cover
under a leaf, hold the book and cover together. This
is further strengthened sometimes by another strip of
muslin. When the back is firmly gummed or pasted
to the book, so as to bend with
it, it is called a flexible back,
which also adds to the strength
of the whole.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img id="i_097" src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>If the reader will now take a
simply sewn or stitched book,
without binding, and will place
across its back two or more strips
of parchment, and glue them on
with the strongest possible cement&mdash;mastic
being the best, but acidulated glue or
flour-paste with glue, or even dextrine-paste, will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
answer the purpose&mdash;and if he will again paste up
and down over these a strip just the width of the
back, he will have all that is necessary to make a
strong binding, for this will hold as well as the
strings. Note that the parchment strips must first
be thoroughly wet through and macerated, or crumpled
till quite soft. Again, that when the paste is
nearly dry the strip should be rubbed in.</p>

<p>Next cut out two pieces of <i>strong</i> pasteboard, each
a very little larger than the length and width of the
book. These are the covers.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img id="i_098" src="images/i_098.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Now paste the outside of the <i>straps</i> exactly to the
inside of the covers, leaving
just enough space for opening
and closing. When dry, the
book should open and close
easily. Then take the outer
cover of leather or cloth, which
is cut in the shape indicated
in the accompanying outline,
paste it well over the back,
and then turn the edges over and paste them
down over the cover inside, so as to form a narrow
margin, as may be seen by examining any book. Also
turn down, before doing this, the edges at the ends
of the book. The binding will be much stronger if,
after pasting the ends of the parchment strips to the
covers, we paste over them in turn good, strong pieces
of paper, close to the back, to prevent the strips from
pulling up.</p>

<p>If there be fly or blank leaves on the sides of the
book, paste one of each down over the inside of the
cover. This will conceal the margin and add greatly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to the strength of the book. But if there be none,
you can supply them, firstly, by a method which will
make your binding even stronger than that of most
books. Take a very strong piece, let us say, of Whatman’s
or any other good tough linen drawing-paper,
just of the size to cover the whole book&mdash;that is, back
and sides. Cut in it four slits, and pass the strips
which are to bind the book to the cover through, and
gum them down, and then paste the fly-leaf thus
added down over the strips. But it will answer every
purpose if you simply gum fly-leaves on by a very
narrow margin of “adhesive.” All of this will become
clear to any one who will carefully examine a
book. And anybody who has the dexterity to fold a
letter neatly or do up a parcel properly, can in a short
time, after one or two experiments, succeed in binding
a book in this manner. I have observed that
those who fail as amateur bookbinders generally do
so because they attempt too much too soon, and aim
at producing elegant masterpieces before they have
learned to manage with ease such common work as I
have described.</p>

<p>Though this manner of strip-binding is little known,
it was, strange to say, the very first ever practised;
for, according to <span class="smcap">Olympiodorus</span>, one <span class="smcap">Philatius</span> was
the first who taught the use of <i>glue</i> to fasten written
or blank leaves together, for which great discovery a
statue was erected to him. Binders were called
among the Romans <i>ligatores</i>, as they are still in Italy,
<i>legatori</i>; and it was here, indeed, that I myself learned
the craft, as I now generally bind my own books.
Those who prepared and sold the covers for Roman
booksellers were called <i>scrutarii</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<p>There is a very easy way to bind up pamphlets,
MSS., or letters when they have any margin for a
back. If you cannot have them stitched&mdash;which,
though difficult to an inexpert, can be done for a mere
trifle&mdash;then sew them together across from side to
side. Where the pages are of great value, gum them
together by a <i>very narrow</i> doubled or folded strip of
adhesive. This done, bind as before, or else simply
paste on a cover of drawing-paper at the back, and
the fly-leaves to the sides. A great deal of loose literature,
flying leaves, clippings from newspapers, letters,
&amp;c., can in this way, at no great expenditure of
time or money, be converted into really valuable
books.</p>

<p>I may here observe that cloth for binding, thin
leather, and even common parchment or parchment-paper,
are much cheaper than would be supposed,
and that the average cost, all expenses included, of
binding a duodecimo book in these would only be
from threepence to a shilling. Any waste parchment
will serve for binding.</p>

<p>Any person, however, who can emboss leather with
tracer and stamp, even though but a little, after a
week’s practice, can decorate and ornament books so
as to greatly enhance their value. Nor do I exaggerate
when I say that here is a field in which any person
who can draw or copy decorative patterns moderately
well might make a living. The reader will find the
fullest details as to how this is done in my <i>Manual of
Leather Work</i>. (Price 5s. London, Whittaker &amp; Co.,
2 White Hart Street, E.C.) In the present work I
can only state that it is executed as follows:&mdash;Bind
your book with cardboard in fairly thick, hard, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
firm brown leather; there is a kind made for the purpose
in Germany. Draw the pattern on it, or else
draw it on paper with a crayon-pencil, and rub it
from the back on the leather. This done, go over it
with the fine point of a miniature brush in Indian
ink. Dampen the leather slightly as you work with
a sponge, and mark the outline with a tracer and
stamp the ground with a matt. You may leave it
brown, but if the work be coarse, I advise painting
the whole with ink or Indian ink, and then coating it
with <span class="smcap">Soehnée’s</span> varnish, No. 3. Rub this down well
by hand.</p>

<p>If you can supply the design (which should always
be bold and simple), any wood-carver will, for a few
shillings, execute it in <i>intaglio</i> on a block of wood,
which should be at least one inch in thickness, and
also have a transverse piece screwed to its back to
prevent its warping. With this you can stamp off as
many covers as you want. Retouch them by hand
with tracer and stamp. If blackened, and then
touched up with gilding and varnished, such books
are very attractive, and should sell well. Any person
who can design, or even trace, a pattern can have it
cut on a block for a few shillings, and anybody having
such a block can print off any number of impressions
in damp leather, and retouch them with stamp
and tracer, and glue them to cardboard covers, for
books or albums, and sell them at a good profit. Yet,
though this has been clearly set forth by me several
times in manuals, &amp;c., I have never yet met with a
single amateur who has attempted it. There is as a
rule far more suffering in this world from <i>laziness</i>, inertness,
and an indisposition to <i>try</i> to do something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
than from any other contaminating influences which
lead to poverty.</p>

<p>When a book is even woefully dilapidated, so that
there is no margin to stitch, do not despair. First
separate every leaf, smooth it, and, if necessary,
dampen it with a slight infusion of tragacanth. Then,
if there is even the twentieth part of an inch of margin
left, take strips of good, tough, thin paper, and
with care stitch the leaves to these strips. For some
severe cases you must use very thin transparent or
tracing paper to gum over the text, but which must
be visible through it. This, if neatly done, does not
look so badly as it would seem. If one strip be folded
and used to connect two leaves, the stitching and
binding become easy. I have already described how
to restore margins and fill worm-holes.</p>

<p>I think that if any person of literary habits will
consider all that is written in this chapter, and will
begin to practise it with deliberation and care, he will
surely succeed, and find it a very profitable and agreeable
occupation. All of such men have pamphlets,
MSS., autographs, letters, newspaper clippings, and
papers, which, if classed and made up into book-form,
would be more available for use, and far more
valuable. I say nothing of repairing old books; it
speaks for itself as an easy and lucrative employment.
And it may be observed that a young man who can
thus bind and repair would make a most valuable assistant-librarian,
though the business can be mastered
very soon indeed; and it would often happen that in
choosing a secretary, where there are many papers to
file or a library to look after, or an assistant in an
antiquarian book-shop&mdash;particularly the latter&mdash;preference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
would be given to one who had mastered practically
what is taught in this chapter. And as on
board ship the best sailor is generally the best mender&mdash;every
old tar being proverbially skilled in repairing
and having a quick eye for emergencies, even on
shore&mdash;so the one who can rehabilitate and “form”
books will probably be a good assistant in all things.</p>

<p>It may often happen to a writer or copyist that he
has occasion to erase a word, and cannot write over
the space lest the ink should spread. In old times
this was remedied as follows:&mdash;A very little juniper
gum, levigated to the finest powder, was rubbed over
the spot with a soft linen rag.</p>

<p>In all kinds of repairing or technical work it is sometimes
necessary to draw circles when the artist has
no compasses. Yet this can be done to perfection,
almost by free-hand, and very easily. Take several
sheets of paper or a blotter; lay on it the piece to be
drawn on. Take a pencil in the fingers, as is usual,
rest the hand on the nail of the little finger as a point&mdash;having
previously pulled the sleeve of his coat well
up, so as to get a full view&mdash;and then with the left
hand draw or revolve the paper. In most cases a
perfect circle will be the result. This is admirable
practice for learning to draw circles entirely by free
hand, as may be found by experiment.</p>

<p>Paper can be made, if not absolutely fire-proof, at
least deprived of inflammability, by being steeped in
alum-water, or in <i>oleum tartari per deliquium</i>, or oil of
tartar. Stationers might find a sale for such paper.
If the document which was thrown by a certain
Duchess into the fire had been thus prepared, it might
have been rescued by a bystander before it perished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>The art of preservation, or prevention of injury, is
allied to restoration, for which reason it would be
well if more people who send books by mail would
use protecting corners, which can readily be made by
anybody with a pair of strong scissors from thin sheet
brass, tin, or iron. Take a piece of metal of a rectangular
shape, as follows:&mdash;<br />

<span class="center"><img src="images/i_104a.jpg" alt="" /></span><br />

Then double it into a triangle over a piece of cardboard,
or of wood, exactly the thickness of the cover
of the book:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/i_104b.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Very valuable books should be kept in boxes of thin
metal, especially in India. Such cases should not be
made to open and shut with a hinged lid, but with a
covering, and like a cigar case. Such cases, or at
least metallic guards, should also be used when a
book is wrapped and tied in the usual manner and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
sent by mail. I am quite sure that at least every
other book which I have received by mail during the
past year has shown on its edges melancholy scars
from its strings, reminding one of the wounds which
the heroic red Indian retained from his bonds. A
guard is simply a piece of sheet-metal, bent as follows,
once or twice:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>These guards are invaluable for packing books in
trunks. Their price is trifling, and in the end there
would be great economy in using them. Books
should not be packed very tightly together on their
shelves. It bursts the binding, especially of modern
works in boards and paper. The old parchment flexible
bindings were in every respect better, and they
could even now be made far more cheaply than is
generally supposed to be possible. I have before me
a book nearly three hundred years old, bound in
skiver parchment (split, or very thin), which has evidently
been much used, yet which is still in good
condition. But parchment need not be prepared very
carefully for ordinary binding, and it could be sold
for half the price charged by law stationers for what
is used to write on. In the United States one must
pay much more for a sheepskin than for a sheep, indeed
in some cases three or four times as much&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
is to say, the skin as a parchment in New York costs
as much as three sheep in the Far West&mdash;and yet the
expense of bringing the skin to the East and of tanning
it are in no proportion whatever to the stationer’s
profits.</p>

<p>Any one who will examine an ordinary old parchment-bound
book, such as lies before me, will see at
a glance why it must be more durable than a modern
binding. In the modern book the <i>stiff</i> back rises full
to the edge, or generally <i>above</i> the level of the sides,
and is made of muslin, paper, or at best of soft
leather. Therefore in time it breaks from pressure
and friction, or wears away. The parchment or vellum
had in most cases this back-edge put back or
kept down as much as possible, and the tough covering
was all in one piece. It is very true that it is not
possible to obtain plain, old-fashioned parchment
now, and that those who would have vellum, or even
sheep, must pay an enormous price for it. This
would not, however, be the case long if there were as
great a popular demand for parchment binding as
there now is for flimsy muslin. Those who prefer
the former will find no difficulty in having it made
for them, and in binding their books themselves according
to the directions which I have given.</p>

<p>I shall in the chapter on <i>Papier-mâché</i> show how
covers for books may be cheaply made at no great
expense, which may be beautifully embossed and are
extremely durable. This is, briefly, by having a flat
mould or die, on which lay alternate coats of paper
and firm paste (into which glue and alum enter), then
passing over them a bread-roller, continually adding
paste and paper till the whole is complete. When
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
finished, rub in black or any other colour, then rub
in oil, rub again, apply <span class="smcap">Soehnée</span>, No. 3, and finally
rub by hand. This will make very beautiful binding.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that, although there has
been of late years, owing to machinery and patent
processes, such immense production of cheap and
showy binding, as shown in photograph albums,
there has been as steady and rapid decrease in quality,
strength, and durability. It is becoming unusual,
even in very expensive books, to find one which can
be honestly and well opened or is well stitched. I
have, since writing that last word, tested it with two
books recently published, one costing six shillings,
the other a guinea. The latter was fairly well put
together and “held,” but was warped in the stitching
and pasting. It was “bad work.” As for the six
shilling book, it cracked <i>clear through to the back</i> at
every page which I opened, and yet I did not open it
very widely. I should say that any amateur who
could not learn to bind books better in a month or
six weeks than these were bound must be stupid indeed.
The examination of a number of other books
shows that what I have said is now generally true,
and that even very expensive and pretentiously elegant
works are not half so well bound in reality as
were common and cheap school-books two hundred
years ago. This I have also confirmed by examining
a number of the latter bound in parchment, which
bid fair to last for centuries to come.</p>

<p>Should this cheap, trashy, and showy style of binding
continue, and with it a constant rise in the price
of everything made by hand, the result will be that
everything durable will be made by “amateurs”&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
is, by people who to artistic spirit unite a certain
personal independence. Owners of libraries will bind
their own books, or else employ people who will work
as artists, and not like mere machines. The vulgar
and ignorant will continue to buy showy, cheap duplicates&mdash;induced
by hearing, “’Ere’s an harticle, mum,
that we’re sellin’ a great many hof”&mdash;while the cultured
will prefer the hand-made, which is not necessarily
more expensive. In fact, if the unemployed in
England&mdash;or the victims of the wholesale steam trash-maker&mdash;could
be taught easy hand-work, as they all
<i>can</i> be, it would be possible to not only vastly relieve
national poverty, but we could have a variety of articles
of better quality. For it appears to be, by some
strange law, a <i>fact</i> that, with all the improvements in
machinery, men can still make by <i>hand</i>&mdash;and well&mdash;pictures,
clothes, shoes or boots, bookbindings, and
works of art generally&mdash;that is to say, anything in
which skill or character can be shown; while, on the
contrary, in all such matters machinery, instead of
making any progress, is, owing to competition, actually
falling behind! Scientific and other journals are
continually boasting of new discoveries and improvements,
but despite this the jerry-built houses of three-fourths
of London, the sawed and glued cheap and
vile furniture (made by scientific steam) with which
they are filled, the average quality of everything into
which skill and taste are supposed to enter, show that
this boasted “end of the century” is also rapidly
coming to an end in good taste and the quality of its
work.</p>

<p>He who will learn to <i>mend</i> with care, taste, and
skill, firstly his books, will find that to progress from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
this to binding and to making elegant covers is only
going from A to B. The binding of the olden time,
while it was incredibly strong, vigorous, and quaint,
was extremely easy to make, as I have satisfied myself
by much examination and personal practice. The
stitching was not with the weakest and cheapest cotton-thread;
still less was it with wires too thin for
the purpose; it was executed with linen pack-thread,
<i>from the top to the bottom of the page</i>, in three or four
stitches, so that the book could really be opened and
bent back till the covers touched without injury to
it. All of which could be given to-day with the
parchment covers at the same price which the book
now costs, and to pay the same profit, were it not that
public “taste” prefers showy trash. Beyond good,
strong <i>stitching</i>, all the <i>necessary</i> process of binding is
very easy. It requires neatness and care, and some
practice, but it is decidedly not difficult. He who
has mastered it will find that other kinds of mending,
and also the practice of allied minor arts, are simply
the succeeding letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>It is a fact, to which I invite attention, that dilettante
amateurs of books invariably understand by
binding nothing more than its refinements and easily
ruined adornment, which books had better be without.
Amateurs of this class always attempt at once
the most difficult work, and generally fail. As a rule,
almost without exception, the prize specimens of
modern binding seen at exhibitions are chiefly remarkable
for ornament, which will not endure handling or
rubbing, such as surface-gilding.</p>

<p>Pamphlets or letters, &amp;c., can be bound with “eyelets,”
and the clamp or punch which is sold with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
them. Or they may be simply gummed together, in
which case use the powerful fish-glue, which holds
perfectly.</p>

<p>The easiest and most effective method of side-binding,
or where leaves are held together by passing the
tie through from side to side, is as follows:&mdash;Have
by you strips of metal, say sheet-tin, one-fourth or
one-third of an inch in breadth; also small rivets or
tacks. Take two strips of the same length as the
pamphlet or papers to be bound, and strike holes in
them with a brad-awl and hammer, on a solid piece
of wood, at regular distances. Then place these
strips on the book, and drive the rivets through the
holes. Turn the whole round, and laying the other
side on an anvil or a reversed flat-iron, flatten the
points of the rivets so that they will hold. Any old
tins, such as are thrown away in such numbers, can
be made to supply strips. A strip of parchment or
strong paper bent over to form a back can then be
pasted over the strips to improve the appearance of
the volume. Any tinman will, for a trifle, supply
these strips and punch the holes neatly for use. They
should be found in every library, and ought to be in
every stationer’s. It may be observed that in inserting
the rivets or tacks you should place them alternately,
one on one side and one on the other. A
lighter form of this binding is to take a flat-headed
drawing-pin, similar to those used by artists, and
have a round, flat tin or brass disc, like a thin sixpence
or threepenny-bit, corresponding to it. In the
latter punch a small hole, and rivet as before. Tinmen
will also punch these discs; in fact, they often throw
away a great many cut from certain kinds of work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>Where the leader may have a great number of
books to bind, he will find it an economy or a means
to secure good work to hire a girl who is an experienced
book-stitcher to come and work for him. He
can thus be <i>sure</i> of having his works <i>well</i> sewed from
top to bottom with strongest linen-thread in ancient
style, instead of their being shabbily wired (and all
wiring is shabby, since the thin does not hold, and
the thick bursts the binding), or still more shabbily
looped together with weak cotton-thread. This
effected, he can easily do his own binding. He may
not rival a Grolier, or turn out such exquisite “gems”
as require to be kept in caskets, and are utterly unsuitable
for use or reading, and, like most “elegant
and unrivalled” modern binding, marvels of tooling
and gilding. But he can most assuredly hope to bind
strongly in parchment as books were bound in the
olden time, and if he chooses to also ornament them
with richly stamped leather covers, he can in a short
time learn to do the latter, as may be seen in the
<i>Manual of Leather-Work</i>.</p>

<p>The great test of excellence in a book is, Can it be
freely handled and read without injury? The most
careless examination of most books will convince the
reader that this test is almost unknown. The exquisitely
whitened vellum bindings of Florence and
Venice, which are stained almost with the pressure of
a lady’s clean finger; the photograph album, so
beautifully stamped in leather as thin as blotting-paper,
which scratches and wears into shabbiness in
a week, if often opened&mdash;all the show-pieces of exhibitions
will not endure <i>use</i>. And it seems as if,
after all the binding of this decade shall have perished,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
that of the common, cheap books of the seventeenth
century will be as good as ever.</p>

<p>A great number of the adhesives and cements mentioned
in this book are quite applicable to mending
bindings or making paper stick to paper, &amp;c. The
following is, however, not only a paste, but also a
glaze, and is extensively used as such on labels, boxes,
and cards:&mdash;</p>

<p>Boil borax with water, and work it thoroughly into
caseine till it forms a clear, thick, and extremely adhesive
cement, which is also much used to varnish
leather or muslins.</p>

<p>It is often desirable to have a varnish or glaze for
the covers of books, and still more frequently a paste,
which will hold very firmly and yet not penetrate, as
glue and paste very often do.</p>

<p>To make such a cement, mix heavy solution of
warm glue with freshly made starch or flour-paste.
Add to this one-fourth part of turpentine and one-fourth
of spirits of wine. This excellent cement is
applicable to many purposes.</p>

<p>To paper walls <i>well</i> we make flour-paste, and to
every quart add ten grammes of alum dissolved in hot
water. Then wash the wall with glue-water, and
cover the paper with the paste. The alum and glue
form a combination which is leathery and insoluble,
and not only arrests decay, but clings with great
force. Most wall-paper put on with common paste
decays more or less in time, and becomes simply
poisonous.</p>

<p>Stamps are, however, very often surreptitiously removed

renders this difficult. It consists of two preparations,
one of which is applied to the stamp and one to the
letter. It is particularly needed in America, where,
according to a statement in a newspaper, <i>nearly one-third</i>
of all the postage-stamps are removed from letters,
cleaned, and used over again.

<p>The chromic acid forms with the glue a substance
insoluble in water, which causes the stamp not to
yield to moisture. The two should be kept in two
cups, and the letter first smeared with one and the
stamp with the other. I have read of a physician
who, finding that his postage-stamps were often stolen,
adopted the precaution of giving their backs an application
of croton-oil, or some similar powerful
“anti-thief-matic,” the result of which was great temporary
illness in his landlady and her family. For

<p>As the ravages of the <i>Book-worm</i> form an important
item in mending books, and as there is always some
interest for collectors regarding this much talked of
and rarely seen insect, I take the liberty of reproducing
from the American <i>Science</i> of March 24, 1893, an
article on the subject. An appropriate motto for it
might be:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Come hither, boy; we’ll hunt to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The book-worm, ravening beast of prey.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<h3>THE RAVAGES OF BOOK-WORMS</h3>

<p>At a meeting of the Massachusetts Historical Society,
held February 9, 1893, Dr. Samuel A. Green,
after showing two volumes that had been completely
riddled by the ravages of insects, as well as some
specimens of the animals in various stages, made the
following remarks:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a long period of years I have been looking for
living specimens of the so-called “book-worm,” of
which traces are occasionally found in old volumes;
and I was expecting to find an invertebrate animal of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the class of annelids. In this library at the present
time there are books perforated with clean-cut holes
opening into sinuous cavities, which usually run up
the back of the volumes, and sometimes perforate the
leather covers and the body of the book; but I have
never detected the live culprit that does the mischief.
For the most part the injury is confined to such as are
bound in leather, and the ravages of the insect appear
to depend on its hunger. The external orifices look
like so many shot-holes, but the channels are anything
but straight. From a long examination of the
subject I am inclined to think that all the damage
was done before the library came to this site in the
spring of 1833. At all events, there is no reason to
suppose that any of the mischief has been caused
during the last fifty years. Perhaps the furnace-heat
dries up the moisture which is a requisite condition
for the life and propagation of the little animal.</p>

<p>Nearly two years ago I received a parcel of books
from Florida, of which some were infested with vermin,
and more or less perforated in the manner I have
described. It occurred to me that they would make
a good breeding farm and experiment station for
learning the habits of the insect; and I accordingly
sent several of the volumes to my friend Mr. Samuel
Garman, who is connected with the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Cambridge, for his care and observation.
From him I learn that the principal offender
is an animal known popularly as the Buffalo Bug,
though he is helped in his work by kindred spirits,
not allied to him according to the rules of natural history.
Mr. Garman’s letter gives the result of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
labours so fully as to leave nothing to be desired, and
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption">“<span class="smcap">Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge,
Mass.</span>, <i>February 7, 1893</i>.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dr. Samuel A. Green, Boston, Mass.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The infested books sent for examination to
this Museum, through the kindness of Mr. George E.
Littlefield, were received July 15, 1891. They were
inspected, and, containing individuals of a couple of
species of living insects, were at once enclosed in
glass for further developments. A year afterward
live specimens of both kinds were still at work. Besides
those that reached us alive, a third species had
left traces of former presence in a number of empty
egg-cases.</p>

<p>“Five of the volumes were bound in cloth. On
these the principal damage appeared at the edges,
which were eaten away and disfigured by large burrows
extending inward. Two volumes were bound
in leather. The edges of these were not so much
disturbed; but numerous perforations, somewhat like
shot-holes externally, passed through the leather, enlarging
and ramifying in the interior. As if made by
smaller insects, the sides of these holes were neater
and cleaner cuttings than those in the burrows on
the edges of the other volumes.</p>

<p>“The insects were all identified as well known enemies
of libraries, cabinets, and wardrobes. One of
them is a species of what are commonly designated
‘fish bugs,’ ‘silver fish,’ ‘bristle tails,’ &amp;c. By entomologists
they are called <i>Lepisma</i>; the species in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
hand is probably <i>Lepisma saccharina</i>. It is a small,
elongate, silvery, very active creature, frequently discovered
under objects, or between the leaves of books,
whence it escapes by its extraordinary quickness of
movement. Paste and the sizing or enamel of some
kinds of paper are very attractive to it. In some
cases it eats off the entire surface of the sheet, including
the ink, without making perforations; in others
the leaves are completely destroyed. The last specimen
of this insect in these books was killed February
5, 1893, which proves the species to be sufficiently at
home in this latitude.</p>

<p>“The second of the three is one of the ‘Buffalo
Bugs.’ or ‘Carpet Bugs,’ so called; not really bugs,
but beetles. The species before us is the <i>Anthrenus
varius</i> of scientists, very common in Boston and Cambridge,
as in other portions of the temperate regions
and the tropics. Very likely the ‘shot-holes’ in the
leather-bound volumes are of its making, though it
may have been aided in the deeper and larger chambers
by one or both of the others. The damage done
by this insect in the house, museum, and library is
too well known to call for further comment. Living
individuals were taken from the books nearly a year
after they were isolated.</p>

<p>“The third species had disappeared before the arrival
of the books, leaving only its burrows, excrement,
and empty egg-cases, which, however, leave no
doubt of the identity of the animal with one of the
cockroaches, possibly the species <i>Blatta Australasiæ</i>.
The cases agree in size with those of <i>Blatta Americana</i>,
but have thirteen impressions on each side, as if the
number of eggs were twenty-six. The ravages of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
cockroaches are greatest in the tropics, but some of
the species range through the temperate zones and
even northward. An extract from Westwood and
Drury will serve to indicate the character of their
work:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘They devour all kinds of victuals, dressed and
undressed, and damage all sorts of clothing, leather,
books, paper, &amp;c., which, if they do not destroy, at
least they soil, as they frequently deposit a drop of
their excrement where they settle. They swarm by
myriads in old houses, making every part filthy beyond
description. They have also the power of making
a noise like a sharp knocking with the knuckle
upon the wainscotting, <i>Blatta gigantea</i> being thence
known to the West Indies by the name of drummer;
and this they keep up, replying to each other, throughout
the night. Moreover, they attack sleeping persons,
and will even eat the extremities of the dead.’</p>

<p>“This quotation makes it appear that authors as
well as books are endangered by this outlaw. With
energies exclusively turned against properly selected
examples of both, what a world of good it might do
mankind! The discrimination lacking, the insect
must be treated as a common enemy. As a bane for
‘silver fish’ and cockroaches, pyrethrum insect powder
is said to be effectual. For a number of years I
have used, on lepisma and roach, a mixture containing
phosphorus, ‘The Infallible Water Bug and Roach
Exterminator,’ made by Barnard &amp; Co., 7 Temple
Place, Boston, and, without other interest in advertising
the compound, have found it entirely satisfactory
in its effects. Bisulphide carbon, evaporated in
closed boxes or cases containing the infested articles,

is used to do away with the ‘Buffalo Bugs.’&mdash;Very

<p>I can remember that many years ago there was to
be seen in the bookshop of John Penington, Philadelphia,
a book-worm preserved in spirits in a vial. The
manner in which this species of teredo penetrates
wood and leather as well as paper is not the least
curious of its habits.</p>

<p>The great amount of injury inflicted by boring-insects

reason for giving so much space to this subject.

<span class="large">REPAIRING TOYS&mdash;MAKING GROUNDS FOR PICTURES
AND WALLS&mdash;CARTON-CUIR AND CARTON-PIERRE</span></h2>

<p>Soft paper, when mixed with water, gum, or, better
still, with flour-paste, forms a substance which can
be moulded to any form, and which, when dry, will
be as hard as cardboard. Its hardness and durability
may be increased by mingling with it many substances.</p>

<p>Combined with soft leather in small fragments or
with the dust of leather, it forms what the French
call <i>carton-cuir</i>. In this, or even in its natural state&mdash;that
is, paper and paste&mdash;<i>papier-mâché</i>, as it is termed,
can under pressure be made as hard as any wood. I
have seen all kinds of articles of furniture made from
it. In America there are manufactories in which
pails or buckets, tubs, firkins, and even durable boats,
are thus manufactured. There is in Bergen, Norway,
a church built entirely of it mixed with lime. For
certain kinds of mending it is very valuable.</p>

<p>Though not so plastic as clay, <i>papier-mâché</i> can,
with a little practice, be moulded into any form. It
consists simply of pasting piece on to piece, pressing
it meantime as much as possible with the fingers or a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
wooden implement like a pestle. The pressure should
be applied as it gradually dries. Any one can thus
make very hard cardboard with a bread-roller on a
board.</p>

<p>If you have the cardboard cover of a book badly
damaged, with even a portion gone, it can be restored
by using <i>papier-mâché</i> in which a solution of glue or
gum has been infused. Glue it specially at the
edges. For such repairing take paper-dust or pulp,
combined with gum-arabic in alum-water solution, or
simply the gum. This is easily moulded and smoothed
into any cracks or torn places.</p>

<p>If <i>parchment</i> be torn away it is easily replaced. Cut
a piece to replace the missing portion, dampen it and
the edge which it is to join till quite soft, then glue
the two together, using pressure. I have just effected
this myself with a cover of which half was gone, and
the mending is hardly visible. Use the broad knife
freely to press down the edges.</p>

<p>By combination with a mixture of nitric or sulphuric
acid and water, <i>soft</i> paper becomes parchment-like
and very hard. This requires careful experimenting,
for its success depends on the quality of the
acid and the texture of the paper. Very remarkable
results have been obtained from this, such as material
resembling ivory, horn, and tortoise-shell, in large
blocks.</p>

<p>Waste-paper is so common and cheap that <i>papier-mâché</i>
can always be made anywhere. It is well
adapted to close cracks in wood, walls, or elsewhere;
and for those who wish for an employment or amusement,
it affords endless facilities. One of these is the
mending or making of toys.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>A common mask is made as follows. On a face
carved in wood and oiled there is spread common
coarse soft paper wetted, which is carefully pressed
down, and more paper and paste added, till it is of
the requisite thickness. It is then, when rather dry,
taken off and left to dry perfectly. It is then painted
and varnished. Should a mask be broken, wet it,
paste glue-paper over it, and paint it again.</p>

<p><i>Papier-mâché</i> is popularly synonymous with that
which is trashy and sham in art, simply because its
capacities and applications are not known. Thus
leather-work was long despised as only affording imitations
of carved wood. But in the hands of a true
artist&mdash;that is, of an <i>original designer</i>, who applies,
and not a mere artisan, who imitates or copies&mdash;<i>papier-mâché</i>
is as much a subject for art as any other material.
It can be used in many ways, more or less allied
to mending, as are all arts. Thus paper in fine powder,
or reduced to a fine paste&mdash;or pulp&mdash;can be, with
a little practice, mixed with gum and <i>painted</i> with a
brush on a surface so as to produce relief. A very
little elevation or depression thus serves to produce
grounds which may serve to give light or shadow to
pictures. Thus pastel painting or crayon in colours
rubbed in, which has always been, even in the most
vigorous hands, a weak or “softly sweet” art, may
be made very vigorous by firmly relieving and roughening
the ground; for, as the great American painter,
<span class="smcap">Allston</span>, often strengthened his colours by mixing
sand with them, so pastel painting which lacks
“sand” can have it supplied by mixing it with the
gum for the ground.</p>

<p>To understand this process more clearly, let it be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
observed that, as the illuminators of mediæval manuscripts
gave relief and the appearance of solidity to
gold by making a raised surface with a powder of
<i>gesso</i> (plaster of Paris) and clay and gum, so this
principle can be carried out to a far greater extent by
giving relief to a ground. Here those of limited
views, who never get beyond the merely artisan stage
of art, will at once decry this as shamming, and as
imitating effect by the aid of modelling, and not being
true art, quite forgetting that all is true to genius,
and everything more or less sham in the mere imitation.</p>

<p>Having a surface, either panel or Bristol board,
which latter had better be pasted to a panel or good
thick solid cardboard, begin by taking a little gum or
glue in tolerably fluid solution on the point of a brush,
and incorporating with it the paper pulp or cloth-dust
to a very soft paste, with which paint what is to
be in relief. The same effect is produced in oil by
using a heavier, thicker kind of paint. That is all
the difference, one being as legitimate as the other.
By intermixing chalk or sand or clay, and by using
glass-paper where the crayon, &amp;c., refuse to take
easily, the relief adapts itself to every substance. In
this, as in every process known, the artist must at first
experiment a little, according to his materials.</p>

<p>Solid sheets of fine hard paper, with strong paste
between, when passed between rollers form a kind of
<i>papier-mâché</i> which, is as hard as wood, fire-proof, and,
what is most singular, more durable than iron.
Wheels for railway carriages are often made of it,
and they never warp under the action of heat or cold,
neither do they crack nor bend. You can make this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
cardboard for yourself of very good quality by this
process:&mdash;Take a sheet of writing-paper&mdash;the better
the quality the better the result will be&mdash;cover it with
good flour-paste in which there is a little alum and
glue and a few drops of oil of cloves, which latter will
prevent paste from turning or souring. Then lay on
this another sheet, apply another coat of paste, and
when it is a little dry or past the softer stage, yet
while still capable of adhesion, lay the sheets on a
hard, smooth slab or table, and pass a roller over
them, at first gently, but eventually frequently, and
with force. Add as many sheets as necessary for the
thickness required. It will be understood that if the
surface on which this sheet is formed were an intaglio-cut
die or mould, the cardboard when taken up would
present a bas-relief of it as hard as any wood, and the
whole would form a panel which could be used for
the side of a box or to be set in a cabinet. If made
of good paper and firmly rolled, this panel will be in
every respect equal to wood for all decorative purposes.</p>

<p>As anybody who can carve wood at all can cut
moulds, and as a wooden mould, if kept well oiled
(or otherwise secured from yielding to moisture), will
serve for <i>papier-mâché</i> and leather or wood-paste casting,
it is remarkable that such work is so very little
practised by the students of the minor arts. That
such panels can be very easily and rapidly made I
know by experience; that the materials for the work
are cheap speaks for itself; and, finally, that beautiful
panels for cabinets and doors, whether made of
carved wood, stamped leather, or <i>papier-mâché</i> bring
a very good price will also be most apparent to anybody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
who will go to a fashionable cabinetmaker and
order them. Thus we will say that a small plain cabinet
costs £5. Put into it six panels, really costing
about 6d. each to mould, and the price will be £10.
Such pressed panels are admirably adapted for binding
books, as, when properly made and dried, they
cannot warp or bend. If covered with relief they
may be made very beautiful. Simply blackened or
browned, then rubbed with oil, varnished with
<span class="smcap">Soehnée</span>, No. 3, and rubbed by hand, they are as
beautiful as polished wood or leather.</p>

<p><i>Papier-mâché</i>, pulp, or paper powder can be combined
with caoutchouc or indiarubber, which latter
can be itself dissolved in benzine, camphine, sulphuric
ether, and other solvent mediums, so as to form a
paste which becomes like indiarubber when dry or as
it hardens. Mixed with sulphur this forms vulcanite.
Or it may be combined with white colouring matter
of almost any kind. This can be applied to mending
the broken noses of dolls, or any other wounds which
these pretty semblances of humanity often receive,
their beauty being unfortunately generally more
shortlived than that of their prototypes. The final
finish of such reparation is a coat of paint. In many
cases this is better when rubbed on with the finger
than when directly painted. The reader who shall
have studied this work will find no difficulty in restoring
any toy.</p>

<p>I may, however, here remark that “no solution of
india rubber can be well moulded without intimate
intermixture of sulphur, aided by heat and pressure.
This is a difficult process, and the amateur would do
well, therefore, to purchase rubber composition, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
he may do at any large shop in which rubber goods
are made as a specialty” (<i>Work</i>, May 21, 1892).</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_127.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It is easy to make any article of <i>papier-mâché</i> if the
mere beginning of a form has once been shaped; because,
after that is set, all that we have to do is to
gradually paste one piece of paper on, here and there,
till it is finished. This beginning is very easy if we
have an object on which to begin.
Thus take a vase or cup. Oil this,
and then lay on and all around it
soft, damp paper. Newspaper will
do&mdash;a <i>soft</i>, white printing paper.
Then, with a broad brush, lay on
paste, and apply a second coat of
paper. Press it meanwhile as hard as you can. Continue
this till the <i>papier-mâché</i> is thick enough. When
dry, take a penknife and cut a line through from
top to bottom. Scale it off, and reunite the edges
with strong glue; then paste over the line of junction
a strip of paper. Then you will have a cup.</p>

<p>If it be rough, cut it smooth and use glass-paper.
When finished it may be painted or covered with wet
leather, which can be worked into relief. Or it may
be made to look like ivory by the process elsewhere
described. Paper may in this process be combined
with soft leather rags; as, for instance, pieces of old
gloves out of which the thread has been taken, old
chamois, bookbinders’ clippings, or the like. This
forms effectively leather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carton-pierre</span>, or stone-paper, is a very useful
composition, which is very fully described by <span class="smcap">George
Parland</span> in <i>Work</i>, July 2, 1893. It consists of paper
scraps, in the proportion of an ordinary washing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
boiler or copper one-half full of boiling water and
about one-half paper waste. Add two pounds of best
flour-paste; also, in a separate vessel, a quart of
water, into which sprinkle a handful of fine plaster of
Paris. Let it stand ten minutes before mixing it.
“When the paper in the copper has become a fine
pulp add the flour-paste, keeping the whole well
stirred. Fifteen minutes after add the plaster, and a
few minutes later rake out the fire from under the
boiler. Have ready three pails of fine ground whiting;
pour in one pail of whiting and stir up well,
adding more whiting till the stick used to stir will
stand of itself in the mixture. Let it cool, and it will
be ready for use.</p>

<p>“Some firms,” writes Mr. <span class="smcap">Parland</span>, “add powdered
alum in the boiling process, others add one pint
of boiled linseed-oil; but if made according to the
previous directions, an excellent <i>carton-pierre</i> will result,
which gives very fine impressions from moulds.
If it be cast in a plaster mould, the latter should have
two or three coats of shellac varnish, and then be well
oiled.... In using the <i>carton</i>, sprinkle some fine
plaster of Paris on a bench, and taking a lump of the
newly made <i>carton</i>, mix it well with dry plaster, adding
more plaster, as bakers would add flour to their
dough. Having worked it well in this way until it
will not stick to the fingers, with clean hands roll
pieces very smooth in the palms, or on a smooth level
board, and press each roll into the cavities and hollows
of the mould, <i>often wetting the edges of the carton</i>
in the mould before adding a fresh piece to it. The
casts must not be more than from an eighth to a quarter
of an inch in thickness, except at the outside edges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
of the mould.... The casts must stand about
twenty-four hours, and then be baked in not more
than 100° heat.”</p>

<p>The reader who is specially interested in <i>papier-mâché</i>
will find a series of articles on the subject in
<i>Work</i>, Nos. 3, 6, 12, 17, 22, 25.</p>

<p>Pipeclay, to which calcined magnesia, whiting, or
baryta may be added or omitted according to the
body required, may be combined with <i>papier-mâché</i>
and gluten, such as gum-arabic or dextrine or flour-paste,
which will form under pressure, or even by
hand-rolling, a very hard and finely grained substance,
which is specially adapted to painting pictures.
Plates or <i>tavole</i> are sold very cheaply in Florence of
<i>papier-mâché</i>, which are as hard, heavy, and glossy as
ebony. It is not generally realised that an expensive
hydraulic-press or steam-engine is not needed by the
amateur to harden <i>papier-mâché</i>. A common bread-roller,
passed many times over the material, will
work it “down and in,” quite as well as direct pressure,
and very often much better.</p>

<p><i>Papier-mâché</i> mixed and macerated with indiarubber
or gutta-percha and benzole (<i>vide</i> Indiarubber) forms
in many cases a very good substitute for leather. It
can also be combined with <i>flexible</i> varnish to make
leather. Very valuable soles can be made, or broken
ones repaired, by taking card or pasteboard and soaking
it in a hot solution of indiarubber. These waterproofed
soles, whether of cardboard or leather, are
easily prepared, as easily applied and renewed, and
they will keep the true sole from wearing out forever,
if renewed.</p>

<p>Singular as it seems, there are not many persons
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
who are familiar with the properties or texture of so
familiar a substance as paper. We know that if
wetted it grows soft, but still remains, as it were,
knotty, and that when chewed it does not properly
dissolve. Yet if the reader will take a piece of thoroughly
wetted paper, and knead or macerate it with
a knife for some time with gum in solution, he will
find it gradually becomes a soft paste, as flexible and
as capable of moulding as putty or clay. This is not
the same as <i>papier-mâché</i>, which consists of paper
merely wet or mixed and boiled with paste, and contains
fibre and knottiness. The finely macerated
paper, combined with an adhesive, is ductile, impressionable,
sets well, and readily receives pressure on
rolling, under which it becomes extremely hard.
Paper thus <i>completely softened</i> is readily made into
sheets, and may be easily applied not only to fill up
worm-holes in leaves and completely torn-away corners,
&amp;c., but is very useful for cracks and cavities in
wood and other substances. It may be made up with
any gums, such as gum-arabic, dextrine, fish-glue,
and also with caseine, gutta-percha, varnish, and
most of the substances used in cements. Paper when
thus softened and mixed with, <i>e.g.</i>, fine glue and glycerine,
or with flour-paste, can be moulded and applied
in ornamental forms to any surface.</p>

<p>There is this great difference between simply <i>wet</i>
paper, however wet it may be, and that which is completely
softened by maceration. The former is always
lumpy, the latter passes under the blade of a knife like
soft clay or putty. When made up with gum, glue,
and glycerine, or strong paste, it is, when dry, like
light wood, but less brittle. Kneaded with Indiarubber
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
solution and glue, it becomes like leather, and
can be used in several varieties of repairs. Rolled
into sheets, this composition makes very good and
cheap artificial leather for hangings. To manufacture
these, spread the composition with a broad brush
or dabber on a slate or marble table, and when rather
dry pass over it a wooden roller. Some practice is
needed not to roll it when too soft. If intaglio patterns
are cut in the roller, the sheets will give them in
relief. It is worth noting here that a great many
pieces of old hangings sold as leather are really only
made of <i>papier-mâché</i>, or <i>carton-cuir</i>, and glue. These
hangings, whether of leather or counterfeited, can be
often bought in a damaged condition very cheaply,
and can be easily restored with this composition, to
great profit. When mixed with white lead, or oil
paint and glue, soft paper becomes harder and firmer,
and under pressure is as hard and heavy as any wood.
White paper with holly wood or white larch or lime-tree
wood in powder, and white gelatine&mdash;better if
bone or ivory dust be added, with a little Naples yellow
(oil)&mdash;forms a beautiful cement.</p>

<p>It will be seen by what I have written that cavities,
holes, cracks, and defects in most substances, including
wood and leather, can be perfectly remedied with
paper in combination with glue, gum, or other substances;
and as it is always to be obtained, a knowledge
of its nature and applications cannot fail to be
of value to all menders and restorers.</p>

<p><i>Papier-mâché</i>, like all substantial or putty-like
cements, involves moulding or casting. This subject
is exhaustively treated in the <i>Vollständige Anleitung
zum Formen und Giessen</i>, by Eduard Uhlenhuth;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Vienna, A. Hartleben, price 3s. On the subject of
paper consult the <i>Handbuch der praktischen Papier-Fabrikation</i>,
by Dr. Stanislaus Mierzinski, three volumes,
which is not only the latest, but by far the most
comprehensive, work on the subject with which I am
acquainted. And here I may observe in this connection
that if my references have been chiefly to German
works, it is because, in the minor technical applications
of chemistry to the arts, and in preparing intelligible
practical treatises on such subjects, the Germans
have been, especially of late, by far the first
nation in Europe.</p>

<p>I may mention that since writing the foregoing passages
I purchased, for a mere trifle, in Florence two
carved heads of the fourteenth century in walnut
wood. They had suffered very much from time and
wanton abuse, their noses having been hacked off. I
made a mixture of soft paper-paste and gum-arabic,
working the two thoroughly in together with a knife-blade
till the composition was as soft as butter. This
thorough maceration is essential to produce a durable
body. With this I filled up the holes, made new
noses, and painted the whole with Vandyke brown,
or brown-black. In a few minutes the restoration
was complete, and the heads which had cost one franc
each are now worth at least thirty francs. I should
say that the portions restored are as hard as the original
wood.</p>

<p>It is not always an easy matter to reduce paper to
a perfectly soft paste, such as is called in French
<i>papier-pourri</i>. A small quantity can be mashed with
a knife-blade and flour-paste or gum. A large quantity
is prepared as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Take clippings of paper and leave them a long time
in water, which must be occasionally changed. When
quite dissolved or soft, bray the paper in a mortar,
and finally boil in very hot water. To give it consistency,
add flour-paste or gum. This makes a very
fine cement, which will receive the most delicate
impression. It is invaluable for all kinds of dry
mending.</p>

<p>As I have shown, it can be applied to make or mend
defective leaves of books, to fill up worm-holes in
leaves, to repair drawings and pictures on wood or
canvas, and when mixed with any gum which sets
hard, to restore, add to, fill, or imitate woodwork.
Under pressure and combined with different powders
it becomes as hard as ebony and fire-proof. Its extraordinary
value and general utility are as yet very
far from being much known.

<h2 id="MENDING_STONE-WORK">MENDING STONE-WORK<br />

<span class="large">MOSAICS&mdash;CERESA-WORK&mdash;PORCELAIN OR CROCKERY
MOSAIC</span></h2>

<p>Mending or repairing <i>stone</i>, involving its imitations,
is a widely extended branch of technical science, and
one which has of late years called forth much invention.
The most widely spread and ancient means of
uniting and repairing this material is mortar, or the
mixture of burned and then slacked lime with water.
Lime is made most commonly from limestone or marble.
It improves in quality when carbonate of lime
in organic formation, such as sea-shells, is used; and
there are degrees of excellence in these, from common
oyster-shells to others of a finer kind, such as those
with which the brilliantly white and hard <i>chunam</i> of
India is made. In certain places mortar, when well
made, becomes with age as hard as flint. In American
towns, where anthracite coal is burned, it rots
away in chimneys under the influence of sulphurous
acid with great rapidity. In the Pacific Islands,
where lime is made from delicate small sea-shells or
coral, and mortar is like a paint or enamel, a missionary
has recorded that, when he taught the natives
how to make it, they whitewashed everything, even
to the children, who thus became white people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>The misapplied word <i>mastic</i>, which suggests a gum,
refers to certain modifications of mortar into which
<i>oil</i> enters; also the oxides of lead or zinc. “Oil
forms with these an insoluble soap, which includes or
binds the other materials, forming, after one month’s
drying, a very hard substance,” which some say is as
hard as stone, but which depends entirely on the
quality and combination; for I have seen so-called
<i>mastic</i> applied to coating cheaply built houses, which
cracked or crumbled away like mere plaster of
Paris.</p>

<p>To thoroughly amalgamate mastics, it is usual to
put their ingredients into casks which are two-thirds
filled, and then revolved by machinery. The oil is
then added. At least two days are required for the
process. The following recipes for mastics are among
the best, having been approved by <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>. It may
here be remarked, once for all, not only as regards
mastics, but all recipes in this work, that unless the
materials indicated are of the very best quality, and
the processes be most thoroughly carried out, the experimenter
cannot expect complete success. More
than this, the experimenter must not be satisfied with
a single trial. If every recipe could be at once executed
by every cook, we should find the most exquisite
cookery on every table in Europe. I once published
the correct recipe for making objects of a peculiar
kind of <i>papier-mâché</i> hardened. It was very easy
to make. I had seen specimens of the ware, and I received
the recipe from the inventor. Moreover, a
great deal of money had been made by it. However,
soon after I had published it I received an indignant
letter from the head of a large manufacturing house,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
stating that they had tried my recipe and utterly
failed!</p>

<p>The powdered glass is prepared by heating glass
red-hot, casting it into water, grinding and sifting it.
This powder is saturated with the linseed-oil varnish,
and heated in a kettle. This cement sets hard in
three days. <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> observes that glass-powder
serves in such recipes to resist the action of acids, &amp;c.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
since it forms in combination on the surface a glaze
of great hardness; that is, the glass and lead form a
chemical combination. Pulverised calcined glass
therefore acts not as an “indifferent” but as a chemical
ingredient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caseine</span>, or Cheese, forms the basis of several
recipes for mending stone, as when there are holes in
a block or the mortar has given way. To prepare it
for use (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>), we let milk stand in a cool place,
skimming away with the utmost care all the cream.
Place this on a filter, and pour on it rain-water till it
is purified from every trace of lactic acid; then tie it
in a cloth, boil it in water, and spread it on blotting-paper
in a warm place, when it will be a horn-like
substance. This will keep for a long time. To prepare
it for use, rub it in a saucer with water.</p>

<p>The following cement was used by the Romans
especially in setting mosaics. It becomes as hard as
marble, and sets with great rapidity:&mdash;To one quart
of milk add the white of five eggs, and stir in powdered
quicklime till a paste is formed. This composition
may be used to repair or make <i>scagliola</i>, which
is fragments of marble or stone embedded in a hard
mass. When it sets, polish the surface with rasps,
and rub down with a rough stone, and finally polish
with marble dust, and then emery or tripoli. Beautiful
slabs for tables, columns, floors, and walls can
thus be made. It is valuable for repairing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceresa</span> is allied to this. We make a basis of this
or any other cement which will <i>hold firmly</i>, and press
into the surface powdered glass, which may be fine
or of any degree of coarseness. Coarse grains shine
most brilliantly; fine powder is best adapted to delicate
shading. The effect is best when mosaic stones
and gold cubes are sparingly introduced. To make
the gold cubes, take two small panes of window glass,
cover one side of each with varnish or mastic cement,
lay between them gold-leaf, and join them. Very
beautiful pictures can be made in this manner. Nor
is it at all necessary that they should be finely executed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
for ordinary decoration. All that is needed for
this beautiful and little-known art is the cement, a
quantity of glass or stone of different colours, and a
mortar and pestle. The mosaic cubes, with those of
gold, can be bought in London.</p>

<p>Allied to this is an art which I believe I can claim
to have invented. It consists of breaking waste chinaware,
crockery, or fictile ware into small squares or
triangles, and setting them as mosaic in cement. The
advantage of it is the cheapness of the material, and
the infinite number of shades of colour which can be
selected for it. Its disadvantage is, that it will not
wear as a pavement, but it is perfectly adapted to
walls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A strong, coarse cement for brick or stone work</span>

<p>The blood is stirred as it comes from the slaughtered
beast with a broom for ten minutes to break the
fibre. It should then be mixed with the water and
kneaded with the powder. Glue may be substituted
for the blood. This cement, if properly made, sets
very hard and adhesively.</p>

<p>It may be observed that many of the cheaper
cements can be employed to form large bricks by combination
with broken stone or rubble, gravel, pebbles,
brickbats, &amp;c. Another method, called <span class="smcap">Concrete</span>, is
to make cases of boards, and to form a solid wall by
pouring in the mixture, or ramming it down, according
to its hardness. Thus a house is made entirely
in one piece; but its excellence depends entirely on
the quality of the cement employed, and on the care
taken in building. Simple lime mortar, if not of a
superior quality, hastily formed, as I have seen, is
very apt to crack and break off. Where hydraulic
cement is cheap and good, houses can be built as firm
as granite. A good and strong cement of this kind
can be made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Burned lime</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Caseine</td>
    <td class="tdr">12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hydraulic cement</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The proportions may be very much varied in such
cements according to their price, but generally with
a satisfactory result.</p>

<p>Fractures or discolorations in marble, as in statuary,
are so perfectly repaired in Florence that the juncture
is not perceptible. Even dark spots are drilled out.
The process is to drill a round concave hole, and cut
the piece to be inserted so as to exactly fit as a convex
plug. It is then fastened in with transparent mastic
or other clear cement. It will be seen, on due consideration,
that this is extremely ingenious, because
by it alone can a perfectly tight fit be secured. By
turning the plug in the hollow it speedily grinds itself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
into an accurate plug; so when the cement is applied
it can be reduced to a minimum&mdash;in fact, by this
means the line of junction is reduced to its finest
limit.</p>

<p>Where a very strong cement is needed for stone-work,
it can be prepared by mixing a fine cement
powder&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Portland cement&mdash;with liquid silicate
of soda. As it dries almost at once, it must be
promptly applied. It is particularly well adapted for
building under water, since it then becomes extremely
hard. Before applying it smear the stone with pure
silicate.</p>

<p>The following is highly commended by <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mending statues of gypsum or plaster of Paris is
allied to stone-work. The broken edges are washed
with water till no more is absorbed and the surface
remains wet. Then stir fresh calcined white plaster
of Paris with much water to a thin paste, and continue
to stir this till it is cold. Then rapidly paint
this paste on the broken edges, continuing to press
the two together till they set hard.</p>

<p>It is, says <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, a peculiarity of gypsum that
when mixed with <i>alum</i> dissolved in water it takes a
much longer time to harden, but is very much harder
in the end. Thus, if we let the powdered gypsum lie
for twenty-four hours in alum-water, dry it, and then
calcine it again, the powder when mixed with water
sets to a stone as hard as marble.</p>

<p>Plaster of Paris and alum, combined with the fine
powder of calcined glass, form a very hard and durable
cement, of very general utility in all mending of
stone-work.</p>

<h2 id="REPAIRING_IVORY">REPAIRING IVORY</h2>

<p>Works of art in carved ivory or bone are very valuable
when perfect, yet when broken or defective they
may very often be purchased for a trifle. Yet the
process of mending them or restoring the missing
portions is not difficult.</p>

<p>The first thing to consider is the colour. When old
ivory has only acquired a delicate hue, as of Naples
yellow, this adds to its attractiveness; nor are the
brownish shadows and marks which gather in the
angles of the reliefs repulsive. These may be left
untouched, and even imitated. But a great deal of
old ivory becomes of blackish bistre, or of a dirty,
spotted brown or neutral tint, which has nothing in
common with artistic effect, and suggests, like old
slums in cities, more that is repulsive than picturesque.
To clean such pieces, dissolve rock-alum in
rain-water till it is white or forms a full saturation.
Boil this, and keep the ivory in the boiling solution
for about an hour, taking it out from time to time
and cleaning it with a soft brush. Then let it dry in
a damp linen or muslin rag; it will then be cleaned.</p>

<p>Ivory is often bleached by the simple process of
damping, or wiping it with water and then exposing
it to the rays of the sun; which must, however, be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
frequently repeated. According to <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, the only
perfect and certain process by which any ivory can be
cleaned is to steep the article for some time in ether
or benzole, in order to extract any fatty matter, then
to wash it in water, and finally keep it in super-oxide
of hydrogen (<i>Wasserstoff, super-oxide</i>) till it is bleached,
after which wash again in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To supply Missing Portions.</span>&mdash;Take ivory-dust,
such as can be bought of every ivory-turner, sift it to
an impalpable powder, or else levigate or grind it
down under water as fine as flour in a mortar. Then
combine this with gum arabic, in alum solution, or
the silicate of potash. Egg-shells, levigated, may be
substituted for the ivory-dust, and are even less likely
to turn grey; and very fine white glue or gelatine of
the clearest kind may be substituted for the gum-arabic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis Edgar Andés</span>, in his able work on Ivory, Horn,
Mother-of-Pearl, and Tortoise-shell, explains a process
much like that already described. According to
him, take finely powdered bone (or ivory-dust), combine
it with white of eggs, and the result will be an
intensely hard substance, which can be turned or
carved like ivory. To perfect this the mass should
be subjected to a heat of from 50° to 60° centigrade,
and then to strong pressure. Gelatine or best glue,
with glycerine, is quite as good as the white of eggs,
and it may to advantage be combined with the latter.
Having very thoroughly mixed the composition, take
the broken ivory article, repair the missing portions,
and fill the cavities with the paste. Though not
equal to celluloid as an imitation of new and fresh
ivory, this cement is very much like old bone and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
ivory, and <i>after a little experimenting</i> the artistic amateur
may succeed in so blending the <i>binder</i> or adhesive
with the dust as to take casts which are almost perfect
imitations of the originals. But let it be observed
in this, as in everything, one must not expect perfect
success at a first trial, as too many do.</p>

<p>When the paste is dry, smooth the surface with a
sharp cutter, so as to remove any small projections,
and then polish it, first with fine emery or tripoli,
then with a burnisher, finally by hand.</p>

<p>If you have, for example, an old flat plate of ivory,
like one of the fourteenth century now before me,
which I bought for a mere trifle because it was broken,
lay it in an exactly fitting box&mdash;a strip of tin in a
square will answer&mdash;and fill in the vacancy. The
missing ornament on the upper side can be carved,
or even supplied from a hardened stamp or mould
of rolled soft bread-crumb. This bread-crumb can
be made very hard by admixture with a very little
nitric acid and water. Imitation meerschaum pipes,
which are rather like ivory or bone, are made from
this composition by pressure.</p>

<p>I may here mention that this ivory or bone cement,
which is little known, is admirably adapted to repair
broken inlaying. There was in Florence, in the sixteenth
century, an extensive manufacture of delicate
bas-reliefs for small caskets from <i>lime and rice</i>, which
greatly resembled bone or ivory. It was extremely
durable, probably from being extremely well worked.
Specimens of it bring a high price.</p>

<p>A very slight infusion of Naples yellow, to which a
suspicion of brown, reduced in Chinese white, has
been added, gives to the paste an old-ivory colour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
The corners and outlines may be shaded in Vandyke
brown.</p>

<p>Before attempting to glue or mastic fractured
ivories, they should always be washed in the alum
solution, else they will often refuse to adhere.</p>

<p>When there is a little addition of whiting and a
little oil, very well worked into the ivory paste, and
it is allowed to dry thoroughly, it may be cut or
carved into any shape.</p>

<p>Ivory or bone when very old becomes brittle or
crumbling and falls to powder, because certain organic
substances dry out of it, leaving chiefly lime as
their residue. When the ivories from Nineveh were
brought to the British Museum the celebrated Sir
Joseph Hooker suggested that they should be steeped
in gelatine. This effected a perfect restoration.
When a case occurs in which an ivory article, a bone,
or skull is so fragile that it will not bear the slightest
touch without falling to dust, it may often be saved
by gently <i>spraying</i> on it water in which gelatine or
glue has been dissolved. As the glue may be made
by boiling old gloves, and as a spray can be easily
improvised, it will be seen that excavators and openers
of ancient tombs might by this means save thousands
of curious relics which are allowed to perish.
As it is certainly a species of mending or of restoration,
it is in place in this work. This is especially to
be desired as to skulls of the earliest ages, which are
of inestimable value, of which we have so very few,
and of which thousands have perished which might
have been preserved in the manner which I have indicated.</p>

<p><i>Sprays</i> for spreading perfume or medicated liquids,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
which can be adapted to thin liquid glue, may be had
of all chemists. But we can effect the purpose better
by taking a tooth-brush, or any brush of the kind,
wetting, and then drawing it over a dull edge of a
knife or a strip of tin. According to <span class="smcap">J. C. Wiegleb</span>,
a Frenchman in his time received a very large pension
for this invention, which was applied to spraying
pastels. The Romans made a spray, very imperfectly,
by suddenly squeezing or throwing liquids from a
sponge.</p>

<p>Ivory handles to knives and forks, when loose, can
be best reset by first pouring in a little strong vinegar.
When dry use acidulated glue. A common recipe for
this purpose is the following:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Resin (colophonium)</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
    <td>parts</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Iron filings</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
    <td class="tdc">”</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>Heat, and use while soft.</p>

<p>In repairing ivory it is often necessary to stain it of
different colours. Most of the old works on recipes
contain directions for this. In that of <span class="smcap">Ris Paquot</span>
they are given as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First prepare a mixture of copper filings, rock-alum,
and Roman vitriol. Boil it, let it be for six days,
then add a little rock-alum. The piece of ivory to be
dyed is kept in this solution for half an-hour. <i>To dye
Red.</i>&mdash;Boil logwood chips or cochineal in water;
when hot add lead dross (<i>cendre gravelée</i>) about 25
grammes, keep it in the fire till the colour has taken,
then add rock-alum. This is strained through linen,
and the ivory to be dyed is put into this liquor.
<i>Green.</i>&mdash;Take one quart of lye made from vine-ashes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
(<i>cendre de sarment</i>), 7 grammes of powdered verdigris,
a handful of common salt, with a little alum. Boil it
to one-half; as soon as it is taken from the fire place
the ivory in it, and leave it till properly coloured.
<i>Blue.</i>&mdash;Dissolve indigo and potash in water, and then
mix this with a quart of vine-ash lye. <i>Black.</i>&mdash;Boil
the ivory in the following composition:&mdash;Vinegar,
500 grammes; gall-nuts pulverised, 12 grammes;
nut-shells, 12 grammes. Boil down to one-half.
These are all very strong dyes, which may be used
for other substances.</p>

<p>“Ivory can be softened and made almost plastic
by soaking in phosphoric acid. When washed
with water, pressed, and dried, it will regain its
former consistency.” Ivory-dust thus treated can
be really rendered plastic. The process requires
care.</p>

<p>In the <i>Magia Naturalis</i> of <span class="smcap">Hildebrand</span>, a work of
the sixteenth century, we are told that ivory can be
imitated or repaired with a cement made of powdered
egg-shells, gum-arabic in solution, and the white of
eggs. Dry it in the sun.</p>

<p>Allied to ivory is Horn. Deer-horn was frequently
used as a material whence to make a substance which
was moulded into many forms. For this purpose the
hardest part of the horns was selected and filed or
powdered, and then boiled in strong potash lye.
Thus it became a paste, which was promptly pressed
into moulds. When dry the figures were carefully
polished. Ox-horn can be treated in the same manner.
When cracked, carved horns or powder-flasks
can be mended with this paste; also with mastic and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
whiting. Horn in a soft state is easily coloured by
mixing with it any dye.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>It has been recently complained in a leading review,
in an article on sales of ancient works of art, that imitations
of antique works of ivory are now carried to
such perfection that even the learned in such matters
have been deceived. This is perfectly true, and therefore
it is the greater pity that such imitation, which
is not necessarily very expensive, cannot be extended
to our great museums, the wealthiest of which thus
far seldom get beyond rough, plain plaster-casts to
make duplicates of ivory-work. The artists in imitation
seem to be entirely in the employ of the people
who deliberately sell counterfeits for genuine relics
of antiquity. But, as Martin Luther or some one
once remarked in reference to adapting hymns to
popular airs, “There was no reason why the devil
should keep all the good tunes to himself,” so is
there none why duplicates of thousands of exquisite
works in ivory, bone, and horn should not be better
known to the world. It is possible that, to the world
at large, there is little <i>real</i> interest in such works;
but interest will come in time with familiarity.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> to ivory, or horn, there is a process of applying
an imitation of them to any kind of surface,
which is, when executed with skill, remarkably effective.
It is chiefly executed in Vienna, where it is
applied to leather, plaster of Paris, wood, and wall-paper.
With variations, it is essentially as follows:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>Cover the ground with flexible varnish, then paint
over this with light Naples yellow, graduated as
nicely to some old ivory model as possible. It is best
not to have it all too uniformly of one tone, since old
work often has its shades. The object here need not
be to ape or copy old work, but to catch what is
beautiful in it. Then fill in the outlines of the pattern,
and the dots and irregularities near it, or anywhere,
with brown more or less dark. For this, study
old ivory. Then varnish with <span class="smcap">Soehnée</span>, No. 3. A
great deal depends on the quality of this second coat.
Finally rub down very thoroughly with chamois and
hand, and repeat the process more than once if you
want it very much like ivory. Very extraordinary
and perfect imitations of ivory, bone, worn and glossy
parchment and brown leather, wood, marble&mdash;in
short, of any kind of work of art which has been
rubbed and worn smooth by hand during centuries,
can be made by this process of ivorying with alternate
layers of varnish, colour, varnish, and so on.</p>

<p>When there is no relief the paint itself can be
worked with wheel and tracer, and then repainted
and varnished. This is a very beautiful art, specially
applicable to book-covers, and often useful in repairing
old work. I would here repeat what I said, that
the object of imitating effects in old works of art, or
in other kinds of art&mdash;which is so staunchly repudiated
by mere artisans who themselves are generally
only imitators of the designs of others&mdash;is not to make
counterfeits, but to take from age or art beautiful
effects, however produced, and apply them to work.
Those who are too conscientious to execute stencilling
on a wall, or to use moulds for leather-work, would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
do well to first consider whether they <i>know enough</i> to
design a really good or admirable stencil, or an excellent
mould, for it is in the genius which originates
and executes, not in the mere means, tools, and materials
employed, that art consists. Art does not depend
in the least on either making skill difficult or in
rendering its methods easy; it displays skill, but
scorns the Chinese standard of mere industry. An
artist like <span class="smcap">Albert Dürer</span> would never have prided
himself on only using certain tools as being “artistic;”
he would, however, have made designs which
would have forced originality and art into a photograph.
There are marvellous effects of corrugation
in ancient walls, plays of light and shade and colour
and polish in rock and strand and heaps of ashes,
which <span class="smcap">Leonardo da Vinci</span> knew how to catch and
transfer to different subjects, and at which perhaps
the artisans of his time sneered as “not artistic.”</p>

<p>Age, which gives a certain exquisite charm to wine
and words of wisdom, has done the same to all material
things, of which, indeed, it may be strangely said
that wherever it does not destroy a charm it confers
one, like moonlight, which renders nightly shadows
more terrible or else more beautiful.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that this principle, which is a
very important one, is but little understood. The
manufacturers of all decorative art work at present
endeavour without exception to make everything staringly,
cruelly brand new, or else a mere copy of old
work. What they need is to draw, as <span class="smcap">Rembrandt</span>
did, from age so much of its peculiar charm as is
adaptable to modern work.</p>

<p>I have introduced these remarks because the mender
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
and restorer of old ivories and bookbindings and pictures,
if he regards his occupation as an art&mdash;which
it really is&mdash;is peculiarly adapted to fully appreciate
them. Restoring, like copying, leads to creating new
work. I think that any person of ordinary intelligence
can, with zeal and application, learn to mend
anything as described in this work, and from such
mending it is much easier to learn to make works of
minor art. “Short the step from senator to <i>podestá</i>&mdash;shorter
the step from <i>podestá</i> to king.”</p>

<p>A great merit and peculiarity of ivory, as of horn,
is that it is tough and elastic, as well as of a beautiful
transparent or diaphanous quality. These characteristics
have, with the exception of its graining or
texture, been well imitated thus far only in <i>celluloid</i>,
which is unfortunately too expensive for very general
use, and, what is worse, too liable to destruction. I,
however, confidently anticipate that ere long some
substance will be discovered much superior to celluloid
as a substitute, and probably much cheaper and
less perishable. To <i>celluloid</i> I may, however, add the
sulphuretted preparations of caoutchouc and gutta-percha,
known as vulcanite or ebonite. These are indeed
hard, tough, and elastic to perfection, but very
dark and opaque.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, in his work <i>Die Imitationen</i>, observes that
imitations of ivory must be varied to suit the colour
and quality of originals. This requires a study,
firstly, of the adhesive or glue which is to be used.
This, when colourless, is known as French gelatine,
and is very expensive. In lieu thereof the experimenter
may take best white Salisbury glue or gum-arabic
prepared with alum-water. Secondly, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
body, which may be of carbonate of magnesia, carbonate
of lime, such as powdered marble, sulphuretted
lime, or powdered gypsum, chalk, starch, or flour,
white oxide of tin, zinc, sulphate of barytes or Chinese
white, white oxide of lead. In combining, <i>e.g.</i>,
magnesia with the glue, an addition of ten per cent.
of glycerine gives elasticity and a horn-like clearness.
To harden artificial ivory made with glue, the objects
are dipped into strong solution of alum or tannin for
about four minutes. The tannin is best made from
gall-apples. Objects thus made have an antique
ivory, yellowish hue. Red chrome alkali may be
used in solution with water instead of tannin, but it
gives a stronger yellow.</p>

<p>According to <span class="smcap">Hyatt’s</span> patent, artificial ivory is
made by combining a syrup made of eight parts shellac
and three parts of ammoniac with forty of the
oxide of zinc. This is heated and subjected to
pressure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Celluloid</span> is the best material for making artificial
ivory. It is made by the combination of cellulose or
vegetable fibre in the form of cotton-wool treated
with acid; that is to say, gun-cotton and camphor.
It is sold in thin leaves, &amp;c., which can be softened
at from 100° to 125° centigrade, so as to be moulded
to any form. By infusion of colouring matter, such
as oxide of zinc, cinnabar, &amp;c., celluloid is made to
resemble ivory, coral, or tortoise-shell. It has often
been applied to making a perfect imitation of Florentine
mosaic, and of course serves admirably to repair
such work when broken.</p>

<p>A very strong cement for ivory, bone, or fine wood
is made by boiling transparent gelatine in water to a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
thick mass. Add to this gum-mastic dissolved in
alcohol, this solution being one-fourth, and stir into
it pure white oxide of zinc till it forms a fluid like
honey. This is also of itself an artificial ivory, when
prepared and dried in the mass. Another can be
made by combining diamond cement (<i>vide</i> Glass) with
powdered ivory and a little glycerine. Also with the
same, or very strong white glue and powdered egg-shells,
which latter should have been boiled. Also
white of egg, gum-arabic, a very little strong vinegar,
and levigated egg-shells.</p>

<p>Another recipe for such mending or making of
ivory and similar substances is to take soft and very
white paper in pulp, combined with cotton-wool,
treated with very dilute acid or <i>strong</i> vinegar. To
this add powdered egg-shells, made into paste with a
little glycerine; amalgamate this with the paper and
cotton mixture as thoroughly as possible, and submit
to strong pressure or rolling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cellulose</span> in any form, whether made from cotton,
linen, wood, or other vegetable fibrous substance,
affords a basis which can be treated with dilute acid
to produce a horny or parchment-like substance. A
modification of this is seen in making celluloid with
camphor. These modified forms of organic creation
can be combined with other organic substances or
minerals in great variety. Thus glycerine, and at
times oil of different kinds, in such admixtures confers
elasticity, or a diaphanous appearance; ivory-dust
has an affinity for oil and glue; and these all
combine with parchment, boiled ivory-dust, and fibrine
or cellulose.</p>

<p>Certain marine plants, such as <i>kelp</i>, yield a fibrous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
substance which has very peculiar qualities, and which
admits of ingenious combination. Certain experiments
and observations convince me that there is here
a vast field, as yet unexplored, in which science will
yet make discoveries and afford valuable contributions
to technology.</p>

<h2 id="REPAIRING_AMBER">REPAIRING AMBER<br />

<span class="large">HOW TO PERFECTLY RE-JOIN BROKEN AMBER,
AND TO IMITATE IT&mdash;HOW TO MELT AMBER IN
FRAGMENTS TO A SINGLE BODY</span></h2>


<p>Amber has been admired in all ages and everywhere
from its exquisite colour and semi-transparency.
Many superstitions were attached to it, and many still
believe that to carry a bead made from it is good for
the eyesight. It is principally found on the Prussian
coast, off the German Ocean, but is also picked up in
considerable quantities on the English shore. It is
the gum or resin of a now extinct species of pine,
which was probably much like that in New Zealand,
which produces the gum <i>kauri</i>, which so much resembles
amber.</p>

<p>Some amber is yellow and clear like lemon-candy.
This is extensively imitated for cigar-holders and pipe-mouthpieces,
beads, &amp;c. Then there is the clouded,
varying from white to straw-colour, and the beautiful
golden-brown, which appears so rich in sunlight;
also the dark-brown and black. These dark-brown
ambers are generally seen in old ornaments, and are
of a kind which is dug out of the earth. Light amber
can be darkened to brown by an artificial process.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>Gum <i>copal</i>, which comes from Africa, much resembles
amber, but is less beautiful and more brittle.
Gum <i>kauri</i>, from New Zealand, is very much like it.
Both are used to imitate amber.</p>

<p>There are not many who know how to mend amber
when broken. I am assured that the following is a
trustworthy method:&mdash;Warm the pieces, dampen them
with caustic potash (<i>ætz-kali</i>), and then press them
together. When well done the joining will not be
perceptible. It is said that by this process small
pieces of amber, amber-dust, &amp;c., can be made into
blocks.</p>

<p>In imitating amber, the best pieces of copal are
picked out, put into an air-tight vessel, and dissolved
in petroleum, sulphuric ether, or benzole. After
being dried in blocks this is submitted to a great
pressure. As it dries the pressure is increased.</p>

<p>It occurred to me many years ago that the proper
way to unite copal to a tough body like amber would
be to use a tough or flexible varnish as a binding
medium. I find by the work of <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> on Imitations
that he has verified this by experiment. What
is also important is, that the process of hardening by
pressure is by this means very much facilitated. I
should judge, by all chemical laws, that a varnish infused
with glycerine in combination with copal, kauri,
or amber-dust would, even without pressure, form in
time a substance quite as hard as amber, and much
less brittle. It is to be desired that some technist
would experiment on a variety of gums in this manner,
and thus <i>fix</i> or render permanent their beauty.
There is a wide field here to be worked. The subject
of meerschaum and amber is fully treated in a work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
entitled <i>Die Meerschaum- und Bernstein-Fabrikationen</i>,
von G. M. Raufer; Vienna, A. Hartleben, 2 marks.</p>

<p>I may add that carving amber is a very elegant art,
yielding beautiful results. I have known a young
lady, the late Miss Catherine L. Bayard, who excelled
in it. It is effected chiefly with fine files and emery
or glass paper, as, owing to its extremely brittle nature,
there is much risk for any save experts to use
cutting tools. Amber is a very expensive material,
but objects made from it are of more than proportionate
value. Those who would practise carving it
should begin with pieces of copal. As I have already
explained, small fragments and the dust of both amber
and copal can be melted and combined with clear
turpentine into large masses, which are even tougher
than the native gums.</p>

<p>An inferior, but still very pretty, imitation of amber
can be made by combining almost any gum properly
clarified and coloured; as, for instance, gum-arabic
or dextrine with gelatine (best quality white)
and glycerine. If thoroughly well combined and
dried, this will wear as well as amber. Some of the
gums of fruit-trees&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, of the peach and cherry&mdash;are
very beautifully coloured and clear, and seem to
be admirably adapted to be hardened by the same
process. They occur very frequently in old books of
recipes as adhesives or cements. Perfectly clear glue
or gelatine with glycerine and transparent dyes form
an excellent imitation for beads.

<h2 id="INDIARUBBER_AND">INDIARUBBER AND
GUTTA-PERCHA<br />

<span class="large">MENDING INDIARUBBER SHOES AND MAKING GARMENTS
WATERPROOF, WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS</span></h2>

<p>Indiarubber or gutta-percha enters into so many
familiar and useful objects that there are few people
who would not like to know how to repair them when
injured.</p>

<p>Like the brittle or non-elastic gums, caoutchouc
(with which I include the nearly allied gutta-percha)
is greatly modified by admixture with certain pulverised
substances, which form with it a partly mechanical,
partly chemical, combination. Those who would
thoroughly study the subject in all its relations may
consult <i>Kautschuk</i> (<i>Caoutchouc</i>) <i>und Guttapercha</i>, von
Raimund Hoffer; Wien, 1892, Hartleben.</p>

<p>Caoutchouc is partially soluble in carburetted sulphur,
ether, pure petroleum, or benzole, but gutta-percha
is perfectly so. In this state it may be applied
as a varnish or coating for repairs, as it hardens by
exposure to the air. When mixed with sulphur and
exposed to a heat of 110° to 115° centigrade, gutta-percha
becomes what is called “vulcanised,” assuming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
a very light grey colour, is more elastic, and retains
this elasticity at a much lower grade than before.
When the heat is raised to (maximum) 180° the
mass becomes very hard, tough, and black, or like
horn. The conditions of its toughness, elasticity,
and hardness depend upon the amount of sulphur
used; as in other combinations, the harder the material
becomes the less elastic it is&mdash;that is, the more
brittle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ebonite</span> is extremely hardened caoutchouc. It is
first treated with chlorine, washed with sulphate of
soda infused in water, and finally mixed with hardening
substances and submitted to severe pressure.</p>

<p>As indiarubber or “gum” shoes are in general use,
most people would consider them the proper objects
to begin with. To do this, first make two separate
preparations as follows:</p>

<p class="caption">I.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caoutchouc</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chloroform</td>
    <td class="tdr">280</td>
  </tr></table>

<p class="caption">II.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caoutchouc</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resin</td>
    <td class="tdr">4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Turpentine</td>
    <td class="tdr">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oil of turpentine</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>No. I. is simply kept for a time in a bottle or tightly
closed jar by itself. No. II. is made by cutting the
gum very fine, mixing it with the resin, then adding
the turpentine, and finally dissolving the whole in the
oil of turpentine. Then combine I. and II. To repair
the shoe, take a linen patch, steep it in the mixture,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
and place it over the rent. When this is dry
apply one or more coats.</p>

<p>It may be observed that this preparation may be
used not only for indiarubber shoes, but many other
objects. Applied to the soles of leather boots, and
then heated in, repeating the process a few times,
they become perfectly waterproof. This is better
when the shoemaker makes a coating of it between
the two soles. I have tested this often. The inner
sole may be made by simply dissolving the indiarubber
in benzole or ether. A solution for ordinary repairing
can be made by simply steeping the indiarubber
in benzine.</p>

<p>Rents or holes in ordinary leather shoes or other
objects can be very well repaired in this way. A
piece of leather can in this case be substituted for the
linen rag. Boots or shoes which will be very much
exposed to wet should be warmed and then soaked or
permeated with a solution of indiarubber. Preparations
for the purpose can be bought of all dealers in
gum and gutta-percha.</p>

<p>Cloth is generally waterproofed by steeping it in a
slight solution of caoutchouc.</p>

<p>Another recipe (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>) is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caoutchouc</td>
    <td class="tdr">150</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Tallow</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Slacked lime</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>This is used to cork or close bottles. To render it
more resistant, substitute pipeclay for the lime. Or
if in place of either we use red oxide of lead, it will
form in time an extremely hard and perfectly waterproof
cement of great value.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A strong indiarubber cement</span>:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caoutchouc, about</td>
    <td class="tdr">90</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pulverised sulphur</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="i4">Or from 6 to 12 of the latter.</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>This is specially commended as useful to close tins
containing fruits, &amp;c. It is simply vulcanised indiarubber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marine glue</span> is a very valuable and generally useful
cement. It is so called because, being perfectly
waterproof, it is used for many purposes in ships. It
is applicable not only to repairing indiarubber or
gutta-percha garments, but also to objects of metal,
wood, glass, stone, paper, or cloth; as, for instance,
umbrellas, on which, when torn, a patch or strip of
silk or muslin may be gummed, which will last as
long as the rest. It is also good for waterproofing
shoes. It is sold by dealers in ships’ stores, chemists,
and others. “It is a good thing to have in the
country.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hard marine glue</span>:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caoutchouc</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rectified petroleum</td>
    <td class="tdr">120</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asphalt</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>To prepare this, the caoutchouc should be hung in
a linen bag in a cask with a very large bung, or in a
large jar, so that the bag shall be only half immersed.
This is kept in a warm place for from ten to fourteen
days, till the solution is effected. Then the asphaltum
may be melted in an iron kettle. Let the rubber solution
slowly run into the kettle over a gentle heat, and
stir in the one to the other till the mass is thoroughly
preserved are put in the bag; the edge is then turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
incorporated. When this is effected pour the mixture
into moulds which have been oiled to prevent adhesion.
The result is dark brown or black thin cakes,
which are broken with difficulty. The excellence of
this cement is somewhat counteracted by the difficulty
or care which must be observed in using it. To
do this, put the vessel in which it is to be melted in
another or a <i>balneum mariæ</i>, as for glue, filled with
boiling water. When fluid take the kettle from the
fire and subject it directly to heat till it attains a
temperature of 150° centigrade. When it is possible,
heat the object to be glued to 100°. The thinner the
coat and the hotter the surface the better will it adhere,
unless the objects be such as hard boards. In
all cases as strong a pressure as possible should be
employed to bring the two parts together, which
should be continued till the glue has dried. Boxes
which are cemented together by means of marine glue
and are also nailed are of extraordinary strength, and
may be thus made air-tight and waterproof. Those
who intend to send articles which can be affected by
sea-air, such as silks and tea, which change their colour
and quality even when packed in the tightest ordinary
cases, should employ boxes well secured with
good marine glue. It is also invaluable to secure
clothing against moths, for if anything be very thoroughly
dusted and there are no moths in it, none
can get in if it be enclosed in a box rendered air-tight.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of which I would say that in America moths,
which are far more of a pest than in Europe, are
effectively excluded by means of bags of strong
paper, well tarpaulined or tarred. The objects to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
over and warmed, so that it seals itself up. Strong
paper bags are better than any trunks to exclude
moths, but they must always be well gummed up.
Tobacco is no protection at all against these insects.
I have even had an old woollen Turkish tobacco-bag
which had been in use ten years, and which was
partly full of tobacco, almost devoured by moths,
which must have eaten no small quantity of tobacco
in so doing. Nor is camphor or any other scent half
as effective as hermetic closing in some substance
which insects will not eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lehner</span> gives a suggestion regarding the rendering
walls air-tight which is of such remarkable practical
utility that it ought to be enforced by health laws in
every house. Whenever walls have any tendency to
absorb dampness&mdash;and all have it in damp weather,
especially in underground rooms&mdash;it is <i>far</i> more dangerous
than is generally supposed to put paper on
them. This is so much the case that where workmen,
from carelessness, paste one coat of paper over another
on a damp wall, the mass in time gives out a
very poisonous exhalation, so that an instance is
recorded in which several people died, one after
the other, in consequence of sleeping in such a
room. To prevent this take the following waterproof
cement:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Caoutchouc</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Washed chalk</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Oil of turpentine</td>
    <td class="tdr">20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bisulphide of carbon</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resin (colophonium)</td>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Asphalt</td>
    <td class="tdr">5
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></td>
  </tr></table>

<p>These are combined in a large flask, kept in a moderately
warm place, and often shaken till well incorporated.
The wall to be covered should be brushed
and wiped, and in some cases heated, until extremely
dry. Then, using the cement, apply the paper in the
ordinary way. It will stick with great tenacity, this
being a very tight and strong glue. All wall-paper
whatever is more or less productive of malaria in
damp weather, as is the smell of a <i>damp</i> library, or
one where the scent of old paper is rankly and offensively
perceptible. Therefore every precaution should
be taken to render it innocuous.</p>

<p>Even if no paper be applied, this cement is very
valuable when simply used to coat the interior or exterior
of damp walls. It can, of course, be used to
repair many articles of indiarubber, and to mend
shoes, tan garments, &amp;c. <i>Apropos</i> of which latter I
may here remark that all persons who intend to rough
it in the bush as colonists, or go into any region
where mending or getting mended is difficult&mdash;as I
myself have many a time experienced&mdash;would do well
to carry a tight tin box of waterproof glue, with
which torn shoes, and very often torn clothes, can be
promptly repaired. In fact, with the aid of a little
rough stitching, or even without it, garments of
leather, muslin, and even of cloth can be made to
hold together with certain cements, which will literally
bind anything.</p>

<p>It is well worth while for those who propose to live
in the wilderness, wherever it may be, to know
how to prepare or make indiarubber garments. The
recipe is very easily made:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Gutta-percha</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Benzine</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Linseed-oil varnish</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The gutta-percha is dissolved in the benzine; the
solution, when clear, is poured into a bottle already
containing the varnish, and all is then thoroughly
shaken. This mixture, when spread on woven fabrics
of any kind, renders them completely waterproof.
The garments can then be cut out and “sewed;”
that is, bound together with the same cement. According
to <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>, this cement can be used for making
the soles of shoes, and is marvellously elastic.
All travellers, and assuredly all housekeepers, should
have this cement among their possessions.</p>

<p>It may also happen to a traveller to find himself
with an aching hollow tooth in a region where no
dentist is accessible. Should he have with him some
gutta-percha (bleached is best for this purpose) he
may combine it with very finely pulverised glass.
(To <i>levigate</i> or powder anything as fine as flour, it
must be pounded in a mortar, or on metal or hard
stone <i>under water</i>.) Then warm and thoroughly mix
the gutta-percha and glass. Make it into little pencils,
which, when they are to be used, must be dipped
in hot water. This cement may be also used for a
great variety of other purposes.</p>

<p>A very admirable cement, which should be found
in every stable and known to every one who owns a
horse, is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Hartshorn and resin ammoniacum (<i>Ammoniakharz</i>)</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Purified gutta-percha</td>
    <td class="tdr">20-25
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></td>
  </tr></table>

<p>Heat the gutta-percha to 90°-100° centigrade, and
thoroughly incorporate it with the powdered resin.
The chief use of this admirable composition is to fill
up cracks or splits in horses’ hoofs. It may also be
used for plaster on occasion. To apply it to hoofs,
warm it and spread it in with a warmed knife. It
sets so hard that it will hold nails.</p>

<p>In mending or making, it may be observed that a very
little indiarubber or gutta-percha may be combined
with benzole or ether, or rectified petroleum in large
amount, which soon becomes dense. Therefore, to produce
a surface or a skin, we first spread a <i>thin</i> coat
over the object or mould, and then apply another with a
broad, soft brush or “dabber” with great care, so as to
make it of uniform thickness. It is, therefore, best to
have the preparation always rather thin, and use it at the
right time, and not when it has become dense by long
keeping. In the latter case add more of the solvent.</p>

<p>Glass bottles or vials containing liquids are often
broken, even by the pressure of soft objects, such as
clothing, when placed in trunks. It is therefore advisable
to dip or coat them with this solution, which
forms a bag which will contain the fluid; that is, unless
it be of a nature which will soften it. I have known
a bottle of hair-oil to be packed in a valuable cashmere
shawl, which was almost ruined by its breaking,
and which could have easily been prevented by this
easy precaution.</p>

<p>Any apothecary will make up these recipes.</p>

<p>A very curious and valuable imitation of indiarubber
waterproof cloth is made as follows:&mdash;Caseine is
macerated with water and with borax to a solution.
The cloth is dipped in this, and when quite dry, again
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
dipped into a strong infusion of gall-apples. This is
a kind of tanning.</p>

<p>For exhaustive information on the subject of indiarubber
the technologist may consult <i>Kautschuk und
Guttapercha</i>, by Raimund Hoffer, Leipzig, 1892, which
is, I believe, the latest and best work on this important
subject.

<h2 id="MENDING_METAL-WORK_OR_REPAIRING">MENDING METAL-WORK OR REPAIRING
BY MEANS OF IT<br />

<span class="large">FIREPROOF CEMENTS, WITH IRON BINDERS</span></h2>

<p>Metal-work, especially in iron, requires so much
forging and so many appliances that it is to a certain
extent beyond the ordinary mender, who must in
most cases have resort to the smith or artificer. But
there is still much within the capacity of the amateur
to effect, and this I will describe.</p>

<p>One of the commonest requirements in repairing
trunks and many other objects is to make a strap or
strip of metal hold either to a surface or to itself.
This is to be promptly effected by <i>riveting</i>. If the
iron band on a trunk is broken, you cannot well nail
it again into its place. A nail will not hold in the
thin side, possibly of pasteboard. To learn how to
repair in such a case, take a piece of common hoop
iron, lay it on a block of wood or a board, and with
a fine nail or brad-awl and hammer knock a hole in it.
Then take a rivet or any flat-headed tack, put it
through the hole, lay it with the head of the tack
down on iron or stone if possible, and then give the
point a blow, a little sideways. The result is that the
point will be flattened and the tack firmly held. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
result will be the same if the rivet passes through two
thick pieces of metal. In this manner the two ends
of an iron hoop for a box are fastened. Therefore,
if we take a piece of tin or sheet-iron, put it in the
trunk against the side, and bring down the broken
strip on the outside, we can, with a little care, rivet
it. It is advisable, when this is done, to paste a
strong piece of muslin or leather over the tin to prevent
it from cutting anything in the trunk. These
riveted strips are <i>far</i> better for surrounding and holding
many bundles than cords. They are better for
books, because they do not leave marks on the edges,
neither do they untie nor are they hard to fasten, requiring
no knotting.</p>

<p>Riveted bands, corners, or bent pieces of sheet-metal
are more generally applicable to broken furniture
than is generally supposed. The plate thus applied
can generally be concealed either by chiselling
a place for it or by hammering it into the wood, and
then cementing and painting it over.</p>

<p>Wire is also very useful for mending of many
kinds, either in metal or wood. To manage it we
need a pair of cutting pliers or pincers, as well as the
long-nosed and flat pliers. Thus, to attach two
bodies&mdash;for instance, the two parts of a broken gunstock&mdash;begin
by fastening one end of the wire in one
piece, and wind it round both, drawing it as tightly
as possible with the flat pliers. When united, fasten
the other end by driving it under the <i>twist</i> or into the
wood. This also can be so adroitly treated that the
wire, flattened with a file and hammered down, can
be concealed under paint and varnish. By means of
wire passed through holes made with long brad-awls
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
or fine gimlets, picture-frames can be firmly repaired.
In many cases the wire should be brought round and
the ends fastened or wound together; in others, make
a double ring in one end of the wire and nail it down,
then pass the wire through the hole and fasten the
other end in the same way. Many kinds of broken
implements may be thus mended. Endeavour to get
strong, <i>flexible</i> wire for such purposes.</p>

<p>Boxes containing goods will be doubly strong when
protected by strips of iron nailed round them. Hoop-iron
is generally used for this purpose.</p>

<p>Soldering is, however, the best and most usual
means of repairing all kinds of metal-work, and this
is very far from being so difficult as is generally supposed;
indeed, a lady-writer on metal-work goes so
far as to declare that it is fascinating. As every
tinker and tinman knows how to “sodder,” and will
willingly give instruction for a trifle (children, indeed,
often behold the whole process admiringly for
nothing), and, finally, as it is most unlikely that any
reader of this work should be in a place where neither
tinkers nor tinmen are to be found&mdash;for I have read
that a gipsy tinker was once discovered mending a
kettle seated in the shadow of the Great Wall of
China&mdash;it is hardly necessary to describe in detail
processes which any one can take in at a glance.
The principle is this:&mdash;As in cementing glass, the
glue which binds requires powdered glass to be mixed
in it, so that it may establish a quicker and closer
affinity with the glass; so to unite two metallic surfaces
we must have a flux or some fusible substance
as an intermediary. For this purpose various substances,
such as resin and borax, are employed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the solder, which is a compound of metals, which
melts very easily, takes a firm hold of other metals,
and sets hard at once. There are many varieties of
it, adapted to different metals. It is generally sold
in small sticks for use.</p>

<p>I lay some stress on the fact that there should be
some one in every family knowing how to repair,
especially in metal, because there is no household in
which there is not damage of tin and iron ware,
trunks, kitchen utensils, and often even of jewellery,
which a clever youth or young lady could easily restore.
A pin is detached from a brooch. You could
repair it yourself in five minutes, at a halfpenny’s
expense; but no, it must be sent to a jeweller’s to be
mended for a shilling. It is the same with earrings
and chains and bracelets and clasps and securing-rings.
When they become shaky you fasten them
with thread. It will hold for the present, of course;
and then comes an advertisement in the <i>Times</i>:
“Lost&mdash;Twenty-five Pounds Reward!” All because
you never learned how to repair or solder.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_172.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>But, as ’tis never too late to
mend, and no one should be a
mend I-can’t, or go begging to
others to do for him what he can
do for himself, I trust that reflection
on this subject will induce
many to become practical repairers.
If you have a valuable coin,
do not take half the value out of
it, as most people do, by boring
a hole through it. Make a simple twist and eyelet
of a bit of silver wire and solder it on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
edge. Do not tie a gold chain with twine; mend it
properly. Rivet your broken scissors, and when
hinges come out screw them on again. If there were
really anything <i>difficult</i> in all this I would honestly
say so, but there is not, and people who have received
some education learn how to do it all with ease
in a short time.</p>

<p>A recipe for a cement to attach metal to any other
substance is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Purified flint-sand (or glass-powder)</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Caseine or curd</td>
    <td class="tdr">8</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Slacked lime</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>Mix thoroughly, and add water to a creamy consistency.</p>

<p>The following for metals is also very strong:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sturgeon’s bladder solution</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Nitric acid</td>
    <td class="tdr">1</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The acid is stirred in at the same time with the
cement, which should be as dense as possible, and
with this mixture the surfaces of the metal are covered.
“The nitric acid is intended to make the surfaces
of the metal rough, but it has the drawback
that it hinders the drying of the glue” (<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>).
This slowly drying is, however, a great advantage.
The same is found when it is mixed with common
glue, which generally dries too rapidly. Cements
which dry rather slowly take hold the most firmly
and permanently. The acid hardens the mass by
contracting the cellular tissue. To hasten the drying,
the metallic parts, which should be very strongly
compressed together, must be exposed to heat.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<p>A simpler method for light articles of metal is to
wet the surfaces with nitric acid for a few minutes
till they are roughened, then wash away the acid in
water, and cement the metal with sturgeon’s bladder
cement.</p>

<p>A special cement for zinc is made by thickening
very strong dense glue with powdered slacked lime,
into which is kneaded one-tenth part of flowers of
sulphur.</p>

<p>A so-called Jeweller’s Cement, which holds firmly,
is the so-called Diamond, elsewhere given; also the
following:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sturgeon’s bladder</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gum mastic varnish</td>
    <td class="tdr">50</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The sturgeon’s bladder is dissolved in as little
water as possible with strong spirits of wine (equivalent
to ordinary spirits). To prepare the mastic varnish,
mix finely powdered mastic with the most
highly rectified spirits of wine and benzine, and use
as little liquid as possible. The two mixtures must
be then rubbed as intimately as possible together.
When carefully made this cement will serve for anything&mdash;glass
or china, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A cement for zinc</span>, especially for ornaments and
small work:&mdash;In ten parts by weight of silicate of
soda (solution) stir two parts of cleansed chalk and
three of zinc in powder. This is kneaded for some
time into a putty, with which defects, roughnesses,
&amp;c., can be remedied. After twenty-four hours, when
polished with agate, this cement has all the appearance
of zinc.</p>

<p>It may be observed that other metals in fine powder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
may be substituted for the zinc, and that with bronze
powders, oxides of metals, and indeed with all the
range of painters’ colours, combinations may be
formed of infinite application in the arts. According
to <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> the silicate of soda should be of 33°.</p>

<p>A specially strong and valuable cement, capable of
many uses in metal, wood, glass, or china, or to fasten
glass to metal, is made as follows:&mdash;Take best purified
litharge, stir it with glycerine until it becomes a
thin homogeneous mass, which in less than an hour
will become a very hard mass, which is of almost universal
application. It is not affected by water, and
resists the action (according to <span class="smcap">Lehner</span>) of almost all
acids, the strongest alkalies, as well as etherised oils
and the fumes of chlorine and alcohol. The surfaces
which are to be united with it must first be covered
with pure, thick glycerine.</p>

<p>It will readily occur to the reader that in or to this,
as in every recipe given in this book, modifications,
alterations, and additions can be made, of very great
value, adaptable to a great variety of substances. It
is to be observed that in such cases as this, where one
cannot be sure of the exact result, it is best, <i>e.g.</i>, to
first experiment with a very little finest pulverised
oxide of lead with the glycerine.</p>

<p>Another form of this powerful metallic cement is
given as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Concentrated glycerine</td>
    <td />
    <td class="tdr">½</td>
    <td>litre</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Litharge</td>
    <td class="tdr">5</td>
    <td />
    <td>kilogs.</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>To make a cement to fill or close joints in zinc-work:&mdash;Soak
three parts by weight of glue in water,
pour off the superfluous water, dissolve the glue in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
warm water, stir into it six parts of slacked lime and
one of flowers of sulphur.</p>

<p>When ironwork, as, for instance, window-bars, is
to be set in stone, the following is commended as
taking a firm hold:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Calcined gypsum</td>
    <td class="tdr">30</td>

<p>The most important part of mending broken metal-work
is <i>soldering</i>, and this is so difficult to practically
teach by mere <i>writing</i>, while it can be so easily
learned from any tinsmith, or even tinker, that I
deem it common-sensibly best to acquire it from the
latter. Those who would study it in all its details,
scientific or technological, may do so in <i>Das Löthen

<h2 id="REPAIRING_LEATHER-WORK">REPAIRING LEATHER-WORK<br />

<span class="large">TRUNKS, SHOES, OR IN ANY OTHER FORMS&mdash;JOINING
STRAPS&mdash;MAKING CHEAP SHOES</span></h2>

<p>Leather-work when much worn is seldom restored,
and, except by a few experts, it is generally regarded
as incurable. That is to say, that leather-work is
only repaired by the same method in which it is made&mdash;that
is, by sewing&mdash;when in fact a great deal is lost
which might be saved, and much imperfectly repaired
which might seem like new by resorting to a more
scientific process. And therefore, having devoted
much attention to it, I am persuaded that the worst
cases may be mended. Within a week I purchased
two small folio volumes which had been beautifully
bound in black leather, embossed in deep relief,
about 1520, in a style which was then becoming antiquated.
The pattern had been cut in a wooden
mould, stamped on the wet leather, and then completely
worked over by hand with tracers and matted
or stamped in the ground. But the black colour had
been worn away from the relief and turned brown,
and it was otherwise dilapidated at the edges.</p>

<p>I took a volume and where the surface was ragged
moistened it, applied gum-arabic in solution, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
smoothed it down with an agate burnisher. Leather
treated in this way soon becomes like a paste. When
it was all even I painted it over with strong liquid
Indian ink. Common ink would have done as well.
Then I varnished it over lightly with the admirable
<i>vernis à retoucher</i>, No. 3, of <span class="smcap">Soehnée</span>, which is flexible,
preservative, and does not crack. I may add for
ladies that it smells like <i>eau de cologne</i>. This dries
almost immediately. It may be had at all artists’
material shops. Finally, I rubbed it for some time
by hand. Then the binding was as good as new,
yet not too new. It was simply perfectly restored.</p>

<p>I have in the introduction mentioned another work
which I also restored. This was a Madonna in high
relief, very much dilapidated; that is to say, it was
of thin leather, which had been originally made in a
mould, and was accordingly puffed out, so to speak,
like a pie-crust. On the mould there had been laid a
coat of muslin or cotton fabric; this, when dry, had
been very thinly covered with <i>gesso</i> or plaster of Paris,
and on this, when dry, a thin wet leather had been
pressed. I may here note that very often the <i>gesso</i>
was then blackened without any leather being applied,
and that when thus blackened, covered, and
varnished it looked exactly like leather&mdash;an easy art,
which may be practised to profit by any one who can
carve or buy moulds.</p>

<p>On examining this, I found that it would be very
difficult to repair it with good leather. I found in a
shop some thin black sham-leather, such as the Japanese
apparently manufacture from leather dust, made
by grinding up all kinds of leather waste to a powder.
It was wretched, rotten stuff as leather, but all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
the better suited to my purpose. Some of this I cut
into small bits, and with a knife soon mashed it, mixed
with gum-arabic and water, into a very smooth paste.
With such a paste one can repair any tear, roughening,
or imperfection, care being taken that the paste
and leather be alike in colour. With this I filled the
hollows at the back, making the work solid; and
having wetted all the ragged edges and fractured or
torn places, smoothed them down with gum and a
pen or paper knife, supplying deficiencies with the
black paste. When all was smooth and dry I applied
a coat of <span class="smcap">Soehnée’s</span> varnish, and then rubbed it well
down by hand. It was quite restored.</p>

<p>As this varnishing leather may sound like a heresy
to artistic leather-workers, I would ask them if they
would consider an application of tannin in solution&mdash;which
is the preservative principle of leather itself&mdash;as
“inartistic.” Certainly it is not, nor is the
application of <span class="smcap">Soehnée</span> (which is more of a simple
preservative than a glaze) a mere finish for
show.</p>

<p>The leather-paste of which I speak has certain qualities
of its own which make it quite different from any
other substance. We may include in leather “paste”
not only the mere dust made from the dried substance,
but all scraps, and also any thin leather, thoroughly
softened or macerated. Even in the latter
form it is, combined with a binder, really a plastic
substance, since it can be worked into any form with
ease. Mixed with caoutchouc or indiarubber in solution,
and then dried, it is invaluable for mending
boots and making waterproof soles. As I have indicated,
it is excellent for mending old books. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
here I may mention that if you have, let us say, one
cover of a book in high relief, and the other, it may
be, lost or worn plain, you can supply or make the
duplicate very easily, very cheaply, and in a short
time as follows:&mdash;Take a sheet of soft, white newspaper,
dampen it, and press it on the relief. As soon
as possible, taking care not to wet the book, fill in
the back of the <i>squeeze</i> either with other coats of wet
paper, melted wax, or liquid plaster of Paris. When
this is dry, wax or oil carefully the face of the squeeze,
wipe it dry, and make a cast from it in <i>leather-paste</i>.
Thus you will have a facsimile of the relief. From a
solid plaster mould, well oiled or boiled in wax, a
cast may be taken in softened or wet leather, which
is even better; it sets hard and tough.</p>

<p>I may here mention that it is very unusual to see
books bound in deep relief with <i>hand-worked</i>, black,
or black and gold, antique patterns, and that such a
cover, say of eight by ten inches, would probably
cost at least a pound, and be cheap at that. And yet
any girl of ordinary capacity with, let us say, fifty
shillings’ worth of moulds, and two weeks’ practice
in tracing and stamping grounds, could produce from
two to four such book-covers as those before me in a
day.</p>

<p>There is now generally sold in furnishing or chemists’
shops a good waterproof glue. Leather softened
and then well incorporated with this is also waterproof,
and may be used to mend trunks. I have
known a torn boot to be mended in this manner, and
that so well that it lasted for a long time. Even a
leather strap which is subjected to great tugging may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
be restored, if cut or broken in two, by shaving the
edges obliquely, so as to sharpen them.</p>

<p class="center">
<img src="images/i_187.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then apply glue with acid, and before it is quite
dry apply pressure, though not so great as to squeeze
the glue out. Shaving across the edges, judicious
pressing together, and final smoothing are of the
greatest importance in all leather patching and piecing,
because it depends on these to make the juncture
imperceptible. Very few persons&mdash;even shoemakers&mdash;are
at all aware of the degree of perfection to which
mending rents in foot-covering can be carried by the
use of waterproof glue, such as is sold by many chemists.
I have worn such a patch for months, and it
was hardly perceptible. But, like every art, it requires
some practice to apply such patches properly,
and I cannot promise to any lady that she can perfectly
and neatly patch a boot by simply daubing on
a piece of leather at a first trial.</p>

<p>It may be noted that in such strap-joining as that
which I have described, the repair will be greatly
strengthened by pasting very thin bits of leather, or
even of muslin, over the edges and pressing them in.
It is true that this cover will soon wear away, but
meanwhile the mended leather is all the while growing
stronger and uniting more perfectly. Even paper,
glued and pressed on, materially aids to make the
exposed joint unite.</p>

<p>And here I may say that many a lady and youth
would do well to take a few practical lessons from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
any shoemaker in the noble art of cobbling; that is
to say, of heeling, soleing, and patching, all of which
are as easy to learn as steps in dancing, and are even
more interesting or amusing when once mastered. It
is, moreover, an art which will be of use through
life. Those who can do this will probably, if ambitious
by nature, progress to making slippers, it
may be shoes; and he who can do this may be assured
that he never need quite starve to death while
human beings go shod. It is not so difficult as many
think, for I have known shoemakers of very ordinary
minds, and I also once knew a mechanical artist who
learned to make a fine pair of shoes in a few weeks.
In fact, there is a living in a great many things for
those who have once learned to use their fingers.</p>

<p>Few people are aware of the extraordinary durability
of leather-work of certain kinds. There are in
the British Museum Roman sandals, probably made
of raw hide, but cut into pretty form, which were
found in the Thames, and which look as new as if
recently made. I have seen within a day as I write a
gracefully formed pitcher of the early fifteenth century
of very solid black leather, like the old blackjacks
once common in England, which has probably
passed through centuries of use, and is as perfect as
ever. Wood splits, earthenware breaks, and metal
rusts, but raw hide, or <i>cuir bouilli</i>, as set forth in the
old song of the “Leather Bottél,” seems to endure
every trial. As the man commemorated in “Æsop’s
Fables” declared, “After all, there is nothing like
leather.” The reader who may be especially interested
in this easiest of all the minor arts may consult
on this subject my <i>Manual of Leather-Work</i> (5s.);
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
Whittaker &amp; Co., 2 White Hart Street, Paternoster
Square, London, E.C.</p>

<p>Strips of raw hide are without equal for repairing
broken vehicles, wheels, saddles, and similar articles,
because they shrink while drying, drawing everything
tight, and set so hard when once dry that what is
mended is often stronger than before. I have elsewhere
mentioned that the strongest trunks in the
world are made in America from it, as they had need
to be, since there is no country in the world where
the “baggage-smasher,” figurative or literal, is so
much to be feared.</p>

<p>The reader who has occasion to repair anything in
leather should study the chapter of this book which
treats of indiarubber and gutta-percha, the subjects
being in many respects the same.</p>

<p>A strong cement for leather is made by combining
gutta-percha and <i>Schwefelkohlenstoff</i>, or bisulphide of
carbon, with petroleum to a syrupy consistency. A
very good cement specially adapted to joining leather
straps is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Asphalt</td>
    <td class="tdr">12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Resin</td>
    <td class="tdr">10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gutta-percha</td>
    <td class="tdr">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bisulphide of carbon</td>
    <td class="tdr">150</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Petroleum</td>
    <td class="tdr">60</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The materials, excepting the <i>Schwefelkohlenstoff</i>, are
put together in a bottle which stands in hot water for
several hours; when the mass has grown thick with
the petroleum add the rest, and let the whole stand
for several days, shaking it very often. If the pieces
of leather to be united are first heated and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
pressed very tightly together, the adhesion will be increased.
This cement is as well adapted for glass,
crockery, horn, ivory, wood, or metal as for leather.
It is admirable for mending trunks, whether made of
leather, wood, or pasteboard.</p>

<p>When a trunk is made of any of these, and a hole
is broken through the side or top, take a newspaper
and coat it with this cement, applying another, till
there are a dozen or more thicknesses. If, as it gradually
dries, this be pressed and hardened with a
roller, or even a round ruler, it will be much improved.
Glue this into or upon the fracture. In
most cases with care it can be made as strong as ever.
Where a rib is broken it should be promptly replaced.
(<i>Vide</i> Metal-Work.) All trunks should be covered
with waterproof glue or varnish, as it effectually protects
them from exposure to the rain. This is very
rarely done, however, the result being an immense
amount of loss to all travellers. In any town where
there is a chemist’s shop, and where a bit of indiarubber
is to be had, even at the stationer’s, a waterproof
cement can be at once manufactured. The
easiest of these to prepare is the following:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Gutta-percha</td>
    <td class="tdr">100</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pine resin</td>
    <td class="tdr">200</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>The resin is first melted in a pan, the gutta-percha,
in very small bits, being gradually stirred in till all is
amalgamated. When used it must be warmed again.
This cement can be used for as many different articles
as the preceding.</p>

<p>It may here be noted that vast quantities of waste
leather from shoemakers and bookbinders, which sell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
for a mere trifle, can be utilised to make admirable
waterproof carpets and wall-covers. The leather is
first soaked till soft, then smoothed out and mixed
with waterproof cement, and rolled into one flat
piece. This makes a very cheap sub-carpet for winter&mdash;better
than oil-cloth, being softer. For walls it
can be pressed in moulds, gilded, or painted. If
varnished there is no unpleasant smell from it. The
harder it is compressed or rolled the more will all
smell disappear. Even with rolling by hand with a
bread-roller almost all substances&mdash;for instance, paper,
cloth-rags, sawdust, leather, clay, wool, cotton-wool,
when combined with any fit adhesive or cement&mdash;can
be made very hard or tough; and it is remarkable,
considering the cheapness of the materials, how little
this principle is as yet applied.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that there are many people
who do not know what to do when the sole of a boot
splits off or wears away and there is no shoemaker at
hand. If the heel is lost and no leather can be had,
a very good substitute can be cut from wood and
cemented on. A few tacks will make it last as long
almost as leather. If a piece of sole leather can be
got, even from another old shoe, one or two layers
can be cemented on to make a sole. A short screw
or nail through three-quarters of the heel greatly aids
in making the layers adhere. This may also be done
with a vice.</p>

<p>In the town of Bagni di Lucca, where I now am, a
pair of leather shoes with wooden soles, such as are
commonly worn by women and children, cost only
fivepence. They are, of course, rough, but still far
better than none. The sole is rudely and very easily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
cut, with a high heel, from white pine or larch wood.
The upper is a single piece of leather, which only
covers the front half of the foot. It is moistened and
bent into shape, and then tacked or glued on. Many
people simply buy the soles, then the leather, and
make the shoes for themselves, in which case the expense
does not amount to more than twopence. In
Florence there is often added to this the back, or
heel-piece, which costs twopence more, and makes an
almost perfect shoe. This art would be worth knowing
in a wild country.</p>

<div class="center">
<img id="i_192" src="images/i_192.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><i>Italian (Lucchese) Peasant Shoe, costing from 5d. to 8d. per pair,

<p><span class="smcap">Lehner</span> (<i>vide</i> Indiarubber and Gutta-percha) specially
commends for mending soles the composition
of&mdash;Gutta-percha, 10; benzine, 100; linseed-oil varnish,
100. It is extremely elastic and tough, and
therefore suitable to soles. Mixed with black dye,
or made with japan, it forms patent leather or polished
leather. It should for this purpose be applied
with a broad brush in <i>thin</i> successive coats, and well
dried before applying a new one. This is far superior
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
to ordinary blacking; it is more easily applied,
and does not injure the leather so much, because the
latter is often made with vitriol, which, while it
promptly gives a shine, eats away the fibre. Boots
and shoes will, in fact, wear much longer with this
coating than without it.</p>

<p>This is even more applicable to a great deal of harness,
saddle, and bridle mending, and restoring sheet
leather in every form; as, for instance, waggon curtains,
when worn and dry. First soften the leather,
then restore its quality, if required, with tannin or
indiarubber in solution. If very dry and exhausted,
it may first be treated with neat’s-foot oil for several
days. Then sew it up, if a seam, or mend by applying
leather and the cement. If all persons who own
much harness would carefully study this subject,
they would be astonished to find what economy could
be effected by judicious mending.</p>

<p>It may happen that the reader may have occasion
to wish to renew black, glazed leather-work, or to
make a brilliant black pattern on a brown ground in
stamped leather. I have often executed it with success.
In such a case it suffices to simply blacken the
leather with ink or dye, and then coat it with any
flexible varnish; that is, one into which glycerine or
gutta-percha has been infused. Any one who can
draw can in this manner execute very beautiful work
for covering walls, panels, chests, or doors. Or flexible
black varnish can be directly applied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lehner</span> gives a recipe for attaching leather to
metal, which may also be applied to any other substance:&mdash;Cover
the leather with a thin and very hot
coating of glue, press it on the metal, and then wet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
the other side with a strong solution of gall-apples or
tannin (<i>Lohe</i>, extract of oak-bark) till it is thoroughly-penetrated.
The tannin combines with the glue, and
attaches the leather with extreme tenacity to the
metal, &amp;c. It is advisable to roughen the metallic
surface to facilitate adhesion.</p>

<p>By combining glue (and many other adhesives)
directly with the tannin or gall nut astringent we obtain
<i>a waterproof cement</i> of great strength, which is
very useful for shoes. It is, in fact, not at all a difficult
matter, where other appliances are wanting, to
make from leather, without sewing, a soled shoe
when tannin and glue are obtainable. The same can
be done with canvas.</p>

<p>During the great wars in America thousands of
soldiers often went barefoot in winter-time, with
abundance of horses or cattle killed all round them,
because they did not know that a strong moccasin
can be made by cutting out a piece of raw hide, piercing
holes in it, and drawing it up like a bag round
the ankles, as is so commonly done here in the mountain
districts in Italy. I once astonished a soldier in
the war by suggesting this, and he declared he must
try it. It is remarkable how rarely man in an uneducated
state ever <i>invents</i> anything, be it a myth, a tale,
or a practical invention.</p>

<p>If the upper leather of a slipper or shoe be cut out,
it can, if wet, be easily made to assume the form of a
foot by drying it on a last, or even on another shoe.
Let the seam of the back jut or flap over the edge, and
allow full selvage for the rest to turn under the sole.
The latter may be of sole leather. If there is none,
glue two or three pieces of the leather together with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the tannin cement, and roll them over strongly. Then
glue the back and the under-lap with great care.
With a little practice a fairly good shoe can be thus
made. Canvas can be used in the same way. To
dwellers in the wilderness this may be valuable information.
But very pretty ornamental slippers can
be made by young ladies out of scraps of gaily coloured
leather. They can buy a pair of soles, and get
the leather at a leather-dealer’s. This is all simply
substituting glueing for sewing, and strong tannin-glue
holds <i>quite</i> as strongly as a great deal of the sewing
of cheap, machine-made shoes. It would, indeed,
not be a very difficult or expensive thing to shoe or
clothe all mankind comfortably, were it not for the
fashions followed by the wealthy.</p>

<p>These very cheap shoes, made with either wooden
or leather soles, and that so easily that a child can
learn to manufacture them in an hour, can be easily
ornamented so as to be really attractive. Take the
leather, moisten it with a sponge, and then with a
tracer, which is like the end of a screw-driver&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>&mdash;<br />

<span class="center"><img src="images/i_195.jpg" alt="" /></span><br />

draw a pattern in the damp, soft leather. When it
dries the pattern will remain. Then with a point or
stamp, dot or roughen the ground. Finally, when
dry, paint the pattern black, and then varnish it.
Anybody with the least knowledge of drawing can
make and sell such ornamented shoes for a good
profit, as they are as yet hardly known to anybody.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Other colours may be substituted for black, or gilding
applied.</p>

<p>I have in another place shown (<i>vide</i> Papier-Mâché)
how good artificial leather can be made by combining
paper&mdash;best in pulp&mdash;with indiarubber and benzole
fluid solution. Also how soles can be made by steeping
pasteboard in the same, and how these, which
are very easily and cheaply made, can be glued on to
the leather so as to protect the latter from wearing
out, for ever, if renewed. A bottle of this cement,
combined with Diamond or Turkish Cement, will in
like manner repair boots when the sole begins to
split or part; and if applied when it begins to gape,
it will be closed for a long time. This is such a practical,
cheap, and easy method of making boots and
shoes last, that my wonder is that every man who
goes shod, and especially every traveller, has not a
bottle of it by him. Observe that the two edges
should be well pinched or screwed together (a six-penny
vice will answer for this), and the leather first
heated, though all this is not a <i>sine quâ non</i>, but only
an improvement.</p>

<p>Leather thus attached by a very strong cement is
quite as durable and much pleasanter to wear than
“copper toes” or iron heels, which assimilate their
wearers to horses. And it takes no longer to make
and attach a heel or a sole in this manner than to
black a pair of boots, as I have myself verified within
a few hours.</p>

<p>Where seams <i>rip out</i>, the best repairing is by sewing
as shoemakers do, which is not hard to learn, and
I advise all young people to learn it. But where sewing
cannot be resorted to, the cement, well applied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
and compressed till dry, will hold almost any break
for a long time.</p>

<p>I urge ladies of all classes and conditions to carefully
consider this chapter. They are more accustomed
to repairing than men, and will take to it more
intelligently. As their <i>chaussures</i> are made of thinner
leather than ours, they need repair oftener, but are,
on the other hand, so much the easier to repair.
Every mother of a family will at least profit by studying
this book.</p>

<p>Shoemakers’ paste, much used for shoes, belongs
properly to leather-work. It is made by boiling
crushed barley to a thick mess, the water being kept
extremely hot. It is then set aside till fermentation
begins, which announces itself by an extremely offensive
smell. Thence it passes to a stage in which it
is a brownish syrupy mass, possessing great power
as an adhesive. It is now taken from the fire and a
little carbolic acid added to arrest fermentation.
This can be used by itself for an adhesive; it also
combines well with <i>indifferent</i> substances, such as
powdered lime, or chalk, white zinc, ochre, clay,
or umber. It may be as well used for binding
books.</p>

<p>I have already given a very good recipe for reuniting
broken leather straps. I here add another from
<span class="smcap">Lehner</span>. It is very good, but hardly worth the very
considerable extra trouble and expense as compared
to the former:&mdash;</p>

<p>The strap-ends, or pieces of leather, having been
thoroughly cleaned, are now covered with the adhesive
and pressed together between hot plates, where
the work must remain till cold.</p>

<p>A very good artificial leather, perfectly waterproof,
may be made by covering a strip of strong paper, or,
better still, one of glazed muslin, with the gutta-percha
cement. Add to this fresh layers of cement
and paper, till the requisite thickness is obtained.
This is useful for mending soles. Where the gutta-percha
or indiarubber cement is not to be had, substitute
copal varnish and glycerine, or thick turpentine
varnish and a little glycerine.

<h2 id="TO_MEND_HATS_BLANKETS_AND">TO MEND HATS, BLANKETS, AND
SIMILAR FABRICS BY FELTING</h2>

<p>Wool, as is well known, if put into a pair of shoes,
will pack or settle into a solid felt sole if the shoes
are worn. This felt is like cloth. The same can be
done by rolling it like dough on a board with a
roller. Lay the cloth or hat to be mended so that
the felt to be made can be worked into it. Then take
fine wool and clean and roll it thoroughly, working
it into the edges. It may happen many a time to a
man without a needle to succeed in mending garments
in this manner.</p>

<p>Waterproof glue or adhesive, such as is fully described
in the chapter on Indiarubber, may be added
to facilitate the adhesion of the felt to the cloth or
felt ground. There is a peculiar art or knack of
working moistened felt into the edges of cloth, and
of ironing or pressing them down so as not to show,
which can, however, be soon acquired. In this way
cloth may be glued upon cloth with very good effect.
The extraordinary tenacity and fineness of the adhesives
now made, be it specially observed, renders
mending of this kind (which was impossible a generation
ago) now perfectly possible. I advise those
who doubt this to get a piece of cloth and experiment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
for themselves. The patch may not be invisible,
but it will look better than if botched with a
needle. Felt, however, can easily be repaired to perfection.</p>

<p>Large pieces of stuff can be made by rolling slightly
gummed wool, which fact many men do not know,
even when living in the wilderness, where wool or
hair may be abundant. Nothing is so common as to
see shepherds in utter raggedness where the very
shreds of wool left by their sheep on the thorns would
clothe them, with a little industry. The quality,
durability, and fineness of felt depend on the quality
of the wool, and the care and skill of the operator.
Many of the cheap cloths known as shoddy are really
felts.</p>

<p>Felt is easily formed, because under certain conditions
it seems to have a strange tendency to form
itself. The reader knows that a string in the pocket,
subjected to our every movement, will inevitably
tangle and knot itself up in the most mysterious manner;
and so the fibres of wool, if rubbed together,
twine and bind themselves into most intimate union.
I earnestly advise all who expect to live where sheep
are plenty, and tailors or seamstresses few and far
between, to experiment in felt-making, and, if possible,
learn from a hatmaker how it is done. There
was at one time in New York a factory where strong,
serviceable suits of felt cloth were made, and these,
consisting of coat, waistcoat, and trousers, were sold
at retail for five dollars, or one pound&mdash;I myself having
seen them.</p>

<p>When a piece of cloth is thus adjusted or applied
to fill a hole or mend a rent, the edges may be either
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
simply gummed and adjusted, or they may be treated
with a mixture of felt or cloth-dust and gum. In this
case, before the adhesive is <i>quite</i> hard, yet after it has
ceased to be soft, lay over the patch a piece of cloth
of exactly the same kind, and press it with a warm
flat-iron. (<i>Vide</i> Invisible Mending of Garments,
Laces, or Embroideries.)</p>

<p>In most cases a torn woollen garment may be very
well restored by carefully sewing a piece into the
hole, or by uniting the edges with long stitches.
Then make a paste of felt or dust, or short, fine
threads of the same cloth, with indiarubber cement,
and work it over the surface. With practice this can
be done so neatly as to quite conceal the mending.
Pass an iron over the whole. When indiarubber
cement cannot be obtained, glue mixed with one-fourth
glycerine can be used.</p>

<p>Ammonia combined with wool forms a solvent
which is also a cement. I have not experimented
with it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>

<h2 id="INVISIBLE_MENDING_OF_GARMENTS">INVISIBLE MENDING OF GARMENTS,
LACES, OR EMBROIDERIES</h2>

<p>Most people are aware that there are tailors or others
who are such artists in mending that they can sew up
a rent “in almost anything” so skilfully that the tear
cannot be perceived. I have myself seen this done
so admirably in fine black cloth that not only was
there no sign of a tear perceptible, but none was
manifest after long wearing the garment. This
nicety is partly due to skill, but there is also a method
in it. Such mending is specially shown in Italy by
Jewesses in repairing valuable old laces, embroideries,
and the like. As a very large proportion of those
who buy and sell such goods are Jews, it is but natural
that their wives and female friends should be
specially employed in mending. The process which
they employ is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_202.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Thread a needle with one of your own
hairs, then draw the edge of the rent or
tear together in this manner, darning it,
as it were, very finely and carefully, for
it is in this that the whole art consists.</p>

<p>“After this take a piece of cloth as near like to the
stuff you wish to mend as you can obtain. Lay this
piece on the rent so as to cover it, then damp it
slightly, and press it down with a hot iron until the
surface looks quite even.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>It may here be observed that, firstly, the <i>thinner</i> the
thread used, so that it be only strong enough to hold,
the less probability is there that the repair will show.
For this purpose, for extremely delicate mending a
human hair is almost invisible; for most work silk
thread will answer. It is, however, more likely to
cut through the edge than a hair, because the hair is
more elastic.</p>

<p>Secondly, it may be observed that the so-called
darning is really a kind of invisible weaving, and not
a sewing together or a stitching close of edges, which
latter, as it always puckers up or rises, must show
the line of repair. The darning has its strength of
attachment afar off, not close to the edges; it makes,
as it were, a kind of network or a weaving together
of the cloth&mdash;that is, the cloth is woven again into
one piece by an invisible thread which hides itself in
the thicker fabric. The laying down of a cloth of
<i>precisely the same texture</i> as that mended, and then
ironing it, is very ingenious, because one of a different
kind would produce a different impression.</p>

<p>The friend from whom I received the above, Miss
<span class="smcap">Roma Lister</span>, adds that the Jewesses do this kind of
work very well, but ask a franc or twenty-five sous
for mending the smallest rent. However, when the
torn shawl is once finished you cannot see where the
hole has been.</p>

<p>Somewhat allied to this is the patient German
method of mending stockings by reknitting; also
that of spreading strong flexible glue on a patch of
chamois. This is laid under the rent, the edges being
carefully reunited over it. I would here suggest that
if the tear be first carefully darned, even with human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
hair or finest silk, and the gummed leather then applied
to the reverse, the mending would endure for a
much longer time.</p>

<p>There is a stitch known in Germany as <i>Kettenstich</i>,
or chain-stitch&mdash;though it is <i>not</i> that which is generally
known among us as the “German chain-stitch.”
It is peculiarly long and strong, and will hold together
the edges of even soft leather, for which reason
it is generally used in Turkey and Russia to sew together
the many-coloured pieces of leather such as we
see in Kasan work&mdash;slippers and boots&mdash;and cushions
from Constantinople. This is a valuable stitch for
close, invisible mending. It is allied to the lock-stitch
of the sewing-machine.</p>

<p>A great variety of fabrics can be carefully adjusted
and drawn together over a piece of strong, glazed
muslin (of the same colour) covered with waterproof
glue&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, indiarubber or glue and rubber cement&mdash;so
that the mending will not be apparent. This process
is very applicable to loose skirts, or to any garments
on which there is no such severe pull, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
trousers or coat-sleeves. To effect these as well as
all other repairs perfectly it will be necessary to experiment
a few times. Unfortunately nearly all amateurs
without exception make no experiment till it is
necessary to repair something, and then, because they
very naturally botch it, find fault with the recipe.
Yet, strangely as it may sound, there are many cases
in which mending or making fabrics can be executed
far more neatly with a very strong cement, such as
that of mastic and sturgeon’s bladder, than with
needle and thread, the former actually requiring less
margin to hold than the average width of a seam, for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the least possible overlap suffices to bind where the
adhesive is strong. This process of mending is little
known, probably because there has been hitherto very
little general knowledge of the immense strength and
tenacity of certain cements, which have, indeed, only
been discovered of late. For all ordinary mending,
in fact, glue with glycerine, or glue and indiarubber
solution in benzole, will answer as well as the far
more expensive Turkish or Diamond cement.</p>

<p>If the reader will only reflect that a large proportion
of all black and glossy silks are heavily gummed,
sometimes up to their own weight, it will be understood
that there can be no substance with which they
can be more appropriately mended than with cement&mdash;a
fact well known to many who employ postage-stamps
or black court-plaster to heal their rents; but
as this is generally very expensive, and as any old
silk and glue or gelatine, or dextrine, answer just as
well, the latter had better be considered.</p>

<p>There is much weaving of the most exquisite fabrics
done in the East, and even among savages, almost
entirely by hand; that is to say, the threads are simply
attached to a rod, while the woof is worked in
with a needle. Most fabrics can be mended by an
analogous process, which is a remaking the cloth.
Much depends on the proper finishing or dressing the
surface by laying on it a piece of cloth and ironing it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<h2 id="MENDING_MOTHER-OF-PEARL_AND">MENDING MOTHER-OF-PEARL AND
CORAL</h2>

<p>Mother-of-Pearl is the shell of the pearl-oyster
(<i>Avigula margaritifera</i>), much admired for its beautiful
texture and white colour, in which there is a
peculiar iridescence or rainbow play of colours. The
best, and by far the principal portion in commerce,
comes from the islands of the Pacific. It has risen
immensely in value of late years. Almost, if not
quite, equal to it is the East Indian, from the Sulu
Islands, Ceylon, and Aden, or the Persian Gulf. An
inferior kind comes from the Eastern Mediterranean,
also another from America.</p>

<p>The iridescent glaze, accompanied with more or
less of the mother or solid substance, is found in a
very great number of shells; <i>e.g.</i>, the Peter’s Ear
(<i>Halyotis iris</i>) of the Pacific; also in common mussels,
especially the <i>Unio</i>, found in most clear streams or
brooks in Europe and America where there is not
much lime. These often yield pearls of great value.</p>

<p>Mother-of-pearl can be sawed without any great
difficulty into plates, which are polished with fine
sand and then with tripoli. Of late a great deal of
small furniture inlaid with squares and triangles of
this material has found its way from Turkey and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Persia to London. These pieces are simply attached
with cement made of sturgeon’s bladder, mastic, salmiac,
or even glue. They can generally be obtained
from dealers in Oriental goods. <span class="smcap">Abraham Sassoon</span>,
of Wardour Street, will supply them in any quantity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Louis Edgar Andés</span> and <span class="smcap">Sigmund Lehner</span>, both
experimental technologists, have given several curious
recipes for imitating mother-of-pearl. From filing
or grinding, the best mother-of-pearl shell becomes
like a white metal, which can be combined with white
of egg or pure white gelatine to a fine marble-like
substance, which, however, lacks iridescence. Broken
into very small pieces, which are set in a bed of glue
and glycerine, and then covered, when dry, with another
coating of the same, we have what its inventor,
<span class="smcap">Lehne</span>r, assures us is a very good imitation of pearl-shell.</p>

<p>But there is scaled away from a variety of shells a
coating of <i>nacre</i>, or coloured glaze, which when powdered
still retains the pearly lustre. This may be
taken even from the common American oyster or all
mussels. According to <span class="smcap">Andés</span>, who refers, I think,
to this, it can be laid on any substance and covered
with a gum-glaze. He also informs us that the pearl-like
inner layers of oyster-shells, or of any other kind,
reduced to powder and mixed with sturgeon’s bladder
and spirits, painted on grey paper in several
coats, present the appearance of <i>nacre</i>. I have seen
specimens of such painting which were indeed very
pretty, but the pearly iridescence was rather faint.
According to the author, the pearly brilliancy is much
increased by an addition of silver-bronze powder.</p>

<p>I conclude from this, not having in this instance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
experimented personally, save in carving pearl, that
coarse powders of the highly coloured greenish and
other <i>nacres</i> of tropical shells, as well as of the European
mussel and some other shells, can be combined
with binding-gums of a transparent nature so as to
form a very admirable imitation of mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p>I may here remark, in connection with this, that
the common American clam (<i>Venus mercernaria</i>) has a
white shell of intense hardness, which, when polished,
is as beautiful as porcelain or ivory; also that the
purple spot in the American oyster-shell, from which
the Indians made a very hard and beautiful bead,
might easily be drilled out for buttons.</p>

<p>A very beautiful imitation of mother-of-pearl is
made in Japan. It is not, however, iridescent. It is
said to be made with rice. I conjecture that this is
rice treated with diluted acid.</p>

<p>I have before me now a string of 400 imitation red
<i>coral</i> beads, price twopence, such as are commonly
sold everywhere. They are manufactured of vermilion
powder, rice-flour, and gum, and, when they are
carefully made, are extremely hard and durable, so
much so that the composition may be used to mend
broken articles made of red coral. Such objects in a
fractured state are very common in curiosity shops,
but the art of repairing them seems to be as yet unknown,
though it is extremely profitable.</p>

<p>Of coral, <span class="smcap">Lehner</span> tells us that celluloid in combination
with different substances&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, white zinc or
cinnabar&mdash;can be coloured from delicate rose to fiery
vermilion, and forms a very close imitation of coral.
A very good and much cheaper imitation can be made
by preparing perfectly white paper-paste (<i>vide</i> Papier-Mâché),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and combining it with vermilion, zinc, &amp;c.
From such artificial coral very beautiful cups, plates,
and ornaments for inlaying, beads, pendants for jewellery,
book-covers, &amp;c., can easily be made. The
colour can be varied to turquoise, emerald, ebony,
ivory, &amp;c., by simply changing the colouring-powders
used.</p>

<p>There is a very cheap and common imitation of
coral made by dipping vermicelli, twigs, &amp;c., into a
solution of red sealing-wax in spirits of wine. This
is, however, extremely brittle. White marble-dust,
or very fine white flint sand, combined with vermilion
and silicate of soda, is said to produce a very admirable
imitation of coral. The basis of levigated sand,
or carbonate of lime, with silicate, can be varied with
the dyes to imitate any gems, and is invaluable for
mending pottery or stone-work.</p>

<p>Coral and several other substances are also imitated
by combining about nine parts of very clear glue to
one of glycerine. This is qualified with one equivalent
of white zinc or dye-stuffs. Thus the glue basis
is combined with colcothar, ochre-sepia, umber, ochre,
or chrome. This is also a valuable cement for mending
a great variety of objects.</p>

<p>Any fine white shells ground to powder may be
combined with gum and a very little glycerine and
vermilion to make artificial coral; also white glue or
gelatine with glycerine. This may be made in quantity
for casts of all kinds of objects, such as plates in
inlaid work.

<h2 id="RESTORING_AND_REPAIRING">RESTORING AND REPAIRING
PICTURES</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>“<i>The restoration of disfigured and decayed works
of art is next in importance to their production.</i>”&mdash;Field,
Chromatography.</p></blockquote>

<p>I published in 1864 a work entitled <i>The Egyptian
Sketch Book</i>, which began with the following abridged
account of how oil pictures are cleaned:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Three young painters had often heard what the
American <span class="smcap">Page</span> has proved, that by carefully peeling
the pictures of certain great artists, coat by coat, one
may learn all their secrets of colour. So, having obtained
an undoubted Titian, representing the Holy
Virgin, they laid it on a table and proceeded to remove
the outer varnish by means of friction with the
fingers; which varnish very soon rose up in a cloud
of white dust, and acted very much as a shower of
snuff would have done.</p>

<p>“Then they arrived at the ‘naked colours,’ which
had by this time assumed a very crude form, owing
to the fact that a certain amount of liquorish tincture,
as of Turkey rhubarb, or <i>tinct. rhabarbara</i>, had become
incorporated with the varnish, and to which the
colours had been indebted for their golden warmth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>“This brought them to the <i>glazing proper</i>, which
had been deprived of the evidence of the age or antiquity
by the removal of the <i>patinæ</i>, or little cups,
which had formed in the canvas between the web and
the woof.</p>

<p>“The next process was to remove the <i>glaze</i> from
the saffron robe, composed of yellow lake and burnt
sienna. This brought them to a flame colour, in
which the <i>modelling</i> had been made. They next attacked
the robe of the Virgin Mary, and having taken
away the crimson lake, were astonished to find a
greenish drab. When they had thus in turn removed
every colour in the picture, dissecting every part by
diligent care, loosening every glaze by solvents too
numerous to mention&mdash;including alcohol and various
adaptations of alkali&mdash;they had the ineffable satisfaction
of seeing the <i>design</i> in a condition of crude, blank
chiaroscuro. Blinded by enthusiasm, having made
careful notes of all they had done, they flew at the
white and black with pumice-stone and potash; when,
lo and behold! something very rubicund appeared,
which further excavation declared was the tip of the
red&mdash;nose of King George the Fourth! The Titian
for which they had sacrificed so much was a false
god.”</p>

<p>The foregoing extracts were dictated by the late
<span class="smcap">Henry Merritt</span>, a very distinguished restorer and
artist, the author of <i>Pictures and Art separated in the
Works of the Old Masters</i>, and other works of which I
can truly say that the name <span class="smcap">Merritt</span> indicates that
<i>nomen est omen</i>. I was often by him while at his work,
and had the benefit of seeing the processes employed
and the progress which he made in bringing to light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the “buried beauties” of pictures by great artists.
What I have since learned in addition will be found
in the following pages.</p>

<p>Though it is simple and easy to describe the manner
in which old pictures in general are restored, it
must be borne in mind that, as regards a detailed and
comprehensive description, the task would be the
most difficult in the whole range of repairing; for
when a picture has suffered so much that repainting
is absolutely necessary, then nothing but the skill of
the original artist himself would ever do full justice
to it. In many cases we have pictures, like decayed
works in wood, so far gone that only a mere hint or
sketch of the original remains, so that they are generally
deemed not worth keeping. In such cases the
restorer or repairer may very well do his best. There
is, and always will be, an immense field for every
skilled repairer in this remaking of antiques, to great
profit, because there is an unlimited supply of material,
almost everywhere, wherewith to work.</p>

<p>To be a perfectly accomplished restorer of pictures
one should be an expert in chemistry, and not only
one very familiar with all the styles and schools of
art, and gifted with great knowledge of the <i>technique</i>
of great artists, but also no mean painter oneself.
There is a very general, but very vulgar and stupid,
popular belief that the restoration and cleaning of old
pictures is a merely mechanical art, about on a par
with house-painting as regards skill or intelligence;
but this I earnestly deny, having found, since I have
practised it myself, that it affords a wide field to ingenuity,
and that the greatest artists living&mdash;I care
not who they may be&mdash;can find in restoration tasks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
which would fully tax all their skill, knowledge, or
genius.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to clean or repair a picture it is
often advisable for the artist to make an outline
sketch of it with great care, in order to correct and
guide him in details. To do this, take very transparent
tracing-paper&mdash;the recipe for making which is
elsewhere given&mdash;then with a soft crayon-pencil, or a
very black lead-pencil (from 3 to 4 B), trace the
whole. If the paper be not transparent enough, then
use thin glass, or, what is far better, sheets of mica,
gummed together at the edges, which will not break
even if dropped. Trace the picture on this with a
fine brush and black oil-colour, or any black paint
which will hold. Then make a tracing from this on
transparent paper. To transfer crayon or lead pencil
drawing to wood or paper, very slightly dampen the
surface of the latter, lay the tracing on it face down,
and rub the back of the latter with a burnisher or
ivory paper-knife. It will thus be perfectly transferred.
This making preparatory sketches or copies
will be found in many cases extremely useful, as
training the eye carefully to the work to be done.</p>

<p>It is not <i>invariably</i> true, though a great authority
on picture-cleaning (<span class="smcap">Henry Mogford</span>) has declared
the contrary&mdash;that “pictures ... unquestionably
enjoy their highest perfection at the first moment of
production.” Many artists recognise the truth that
a year, or even years, are needed to give a certain
delicate tone, which is like the ripeness of fruit, to
certain pictures; and the same is true of certain
artists, though by no means in the same degree of all.
But there are many persons who can associate the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
mellowing tones of age or the venerable grey of antiquity
with nothing but dirt, decay, and poverty; as
was the case with an Italian marquis, who, having
heard that a distinguished artist<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> had copied an old
moss-grown wall or fragment of ruin on his estate,
sent an apology to the latter, stating that if he had
known that such a distinguished person intended to
copy it he would have had it cleaned and lime-washed,
not in glaring white (he knew better than that, he
said), but in light blue! So I have known an American
gentleman to be distressed at discovering the appearance
of lichen on a corner of a “spick-and-span,
brand-new villa,” which he at once declared must be
cleaned and painted all over. People who suffer
from this vulgar mania of over-scouring are apt to
imagine that when they detect the least sign of age in
a picture it suggests dirt and neglect, and hurry it
off to the cleaner; unless, indeed (as is too often the
case), they&mdash;with insufficient knowledge, and with
“notions generally derived from guess-work, and
suggested by the usual arrangements for taking care
of other household objects”&mdash;attempt to restore the
work themselves, which has been the cause of the
ruin of thousands of great works of art.</p>

<p>It may here be observed that modern pictures,
owing to the hurried processes of manufacture and
the use of cheap materials in machinery-made paints,
change so rapidly that many lose half their value in
fifty years’ time. And, as if this were not enough,
we have the sulphuric acids generated by coal-fires
(especially that from anthracite coal in America,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
which even eats away the lime in chimneys), as well
as the deleterious effects of gas, vapours from food,
and, finally, the want of air and light in ever-curtained
and shaded rooms.</p>

<p>The causes, in fact, which lead to deterioration in
pictures are almost as many as those which produce
diseases in man, and in not a few instances they will
be found to be the same. These are, as I have said,
foul air or malaria, or want of fresh air, dampness,
the smoke of candles in churches, too long exposure
to sunshine, the exhalations of charcoal, sulphur,
sinks, &amp;c.; “in short, all penetrating scents are injurious
to painting, especially if it be new.” Owing
to this prevalence of gas and coal smoke in houses,
allied to the bad quality of paints, as now manufactured
cheaply by machinery, it is, indeed, considered
doubtful whether any of the pictures painted
during the reign of Queen Victoria will exist in “half-visible”
condition fifty or a hundred years hence.
There is, as regards them, a grand future for the restorer.
One need only look at most of Turner’s
earlier pictures to fully verify what is here asserted.</p>

<p>The face of all old pictures long untouched will
always be found covered more or less with what is
simply dirt; that is, dust more or less dissolved by
moisture. Now, dust consists simply of all kinds of
substances, even invisible extinct animal organisms
in vast numbers. The first step is simply to wash
away this dirt with distilled or rain water and ox-gall.
Use a very soft, clean sponge, and pass it over
the picture many times. The last time wrap the
sponge in a clean, white linen or muslin handkerchief
to see whether the surface is quite clean. This and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
nothing more will often produce an astonishing improvement.</p>

<p>The next task will be to remove the varnish. <i>Hot</i>
water attacks any varnish, reducing it to a dry powder;
but, as M. <span class="smcap">Goupil</span> remarks, this is <i>très hasarde</i>,
or is very risky, because it may also attack and dissolve
anything like gum or glue in the colours. M.
<span class="smcap">Goupil</span>, however, sanctions the use of cold water in
cleaning even to mere abuse, in which he is in contradiction
to <span class="smcap">Henry Mogford</span>, whose work I regard
as by far the best with which I am acquainted on the
subject of cleaning and restoring pictures which I
have read.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> On this subject he says:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“During all operations of lining, and of picture-cleaning
generally, saturation by water is attended
with disastrous effects, and the use of it should therefore
be limited to application by means of a squeezed
piece of sponge, or, what is better, a piece of buff
leather, soaked and wrung out. Water is a most
dangerous enemy to pictures; it penetrates to the
priming or ground, loosens them by promoting decomposition
of the size with which they are worked,
and thus lays the foundation for their eventual disintegration
and decay. Imbibed damp will sooner
or later cause the destruction of every woven material,
and while our daily experience shows its lamentable
effects on the walls of our dwellings, it will be
well for us to remember that it is no less destructive
to the canvas of our pictures, and to the materials
which form its priming.</p>

<p>“All the pictures of the early masters of the Italian
school, and those of Claude and William Vandervelde,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
which are painted on chalk and absorbent
grounds, are in the greatest danger if washed with
water. It penetrates through the small crevices which
may exist in the paint, and often totally destroys the
picture. If the painting be upon canvas, like those
of the two latter-named masters, it breaks into a
thousand small lines or cracks; and if upon panel,
like the pictures of Raffaelle, Andrea del Sarto, or
Fra Bartolomeo, it breaks up the paint by scaling it
off in small points of the size of a pin’s head. If the
picture, again, is of the Spanish school, and is painted
upon the red absorbent grounds and upon a rough
canvas, water not only breaks the unity of its surface,
but from the canvas being of a coarser texture than
the pictures of Claude or William Vandervelde, it
often penetrates in a greater proportion, and frequently
scales off pieces as large as a sixpence, especially
in the dark shadows, or where the ground has
not been sufficiently protected by a thick <i>impasto</i>
(heavy coat or ground) of colour. At all times and
to all pictures water is more or less dangerous, unless
used with the greatest caution, and then it should
only be applied by means of a piece of thick buckskin
leather well wrung out, and left just wet enough to
slip lightly over the surface of the picture. In the
case of some masters, as with those we have specialised
above, the free use of water may be regarded as
next door to absolute destruction; and the warmer
and drier the weather the more active and ruinous
the operation. Instances have occurred in which an
Andrea del Sarto, a Claude and a William Vandervelde,
were destroyed in a few minutes by the injudicious
use of simple water.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have given this quotation in full, because water
is generally the first thing freely resorted to clean
pictures by the ignorant. Thus I have heard of very
valuable pictures being actually given to common servants
or the washerwoman to scour clean, which was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
effected with soap and hot water and sand, to the
speedy ruin of the work. Nor is it any great wonder
that this should be done, when we find in <span class="smcap">Goupil’s</span>
work that, while he admits that cold water “infiltrates
itself partially to the fissures of a painting and
does great harm,” he declares that “<i>hot</i> water acts
differently,” giving the impression that it may be
very freely used, and declaring that “clean cold
water harmlessly dissolves grease and dirt resulting
from dust deposited by the air.” This is true, but
he does not seem, like Mr. <span class="smcap">Mogford</span>, to have fully
understood the other side of the question. (<i>Manuel
Général et Complet de la Peinture à l’Huile</i>, par F.
<span class="smcap">Goupil</span>.)</p>

<p>For first cleaning away impurities from a surface
<span class="smcap">Mogford</span> recommends <i>ox-gall</i> to be applied with a
soft brush. This may be obtained in shilling or six-penny
bottles from Winsor &amp; Newton, or any other
dealers in artists’ materials. “It is,” he adds, “an
excellent detergent, which may be freely applied
without fear. It must, however, be well washed”
(<i>i.e.</i>, wiped) “off with pure water, or it will leave a
clamminess on the surface that may prevent the varnish,
afterwards applied, from drying.” But a distinction
must be carefully borne in mind between
<i>washing</i> with water and letting it <i>soak</i> into a picture
and simply wiping off the surface with a damp
chamois or buckskin or soft <i>old</i> linen handkerchief.
In fact, this latter is the first thing to be done before
slightly cleaning the surface with the diluted ox-gall.
It is very necessary that the skilled cleaner shall understand
exactly the nature of varnishes, so as to
know on what he is to work. Thus, according to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
the picture, he may employ “liquor potassæ, oil of
tartar, spirits of wine, pure alcohol, liquor ammoniæ
fortis, naphtha, ether, soda, and oil of spike or lavender.
The very nomenclature of these powerful
agents will at once show the great risk of their being
injudiciously or carelessly employed.”</p>

<p>Great care should be taken not to allow an excessive
or unequal quantity of cleaning fluid to gather in
one place. Therefore all pictures should be laid flat
while being restored, as streams, for instance of ammonia,
would cut very irregularly into a surface.
With pictures of any value, the process of cleaning is
always very delicate, requiring much practice and
very perfect knowledge of all the principles of the art.</p>

<p>Where the varnishes are tender and thin, such as
mastic, <span class="smcap">Mogford</span> advises the use of spirits of wine;
but to be sure that no harm can be done by it, it is
desirable that “the spirit, which is usually sold at
58° of strength, should be diluted by a fourth part of
water, or by the same proportion of rectified spirits
of turpentine, or it may be used with an addition of
a sixth part of linseed oil, added to the diluted or
pure spirit.” In every instance the mixture is to be
“well shaken before taken,” or applied. Care should
be taken to prevent oil from softening the paint,
which it is apt to do. As a rule it is best to begin
with the lightest or brightest portions of a picture&mdash;as,
for instance, the face of a portrait&mdash;as these parts
are always the hardest. Beginning by wiping the
surface with white cotton wool and turpentine, observe
if any varnish comes off on it, and as soon as it
is seen change the part of the rubber used, else you
will go on simply taking up “dirt” from one place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
and rubbing it into another. This is elsewhere explained
as regards cleaning cloth or absorbing ink,
that we must continually subtract from and not add
again to the ground.</p>

<p>“Turpentine is a counteracting medium, which instantly
arrests the action of the solvent spirit.”
When all the varnish has thus been removed, the
whole may be wiped over with spirits of turpentine,
and then when dry revarnished, if nothing more be
required.</p>

<p>Rubbing with the fingers, or powders, or any kind
of dry cleaning must be avoided, or else practised
with great care, since it produces an effect known as
<i>woolliness</i>, which will begin to show very decidedly
after some time. But when a picture has had no
varnish it can only be cleaned mechanically, as by
using tripoli, pumice-stone, or whiting. This method
requires great skill. Sometimes a very fine-edged
scraper or knife is used to thin the varnish before
using turpentine.</p>

<p>“Solvents,” adds Mogford, “are only necessary
to remove <i>varnish</i>.” Unvarnished pictures are best
cleaned by carefully wiping with buff or chamois
leather, damp, not <i>wet</i>, aided by a little powdered
whiting.</p>

<p>Varnish, when not on a picture, may, however, be
removed by rubbing it with the fingers, or palm, or
leather, aided by powdered resin, or rosin. For certain
purposes, as to make a panel of a piano thoroughly
seasoned for heat, and, as it were, enamel it,
a coat of varnish is applied, and when dry is rubbed
down smooth with pumice-powder or resin, and this
process is repeated many times.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>If pictures are painted in oil, directly on canvas,
without a ground, the paint sinks down in between
the threads and lies thinly on them. Therefore if
there is rubbing on the surface the grain of the canvas
becomes very apparent. If oil-paint be laid
directly on a panel of wood, the soft parts between
the hard fibres, lines, or grain shrink away, drawing
the paint with them. Old artists avoided this by laying
on a strong ground of gesso or plaster of Paris
mixed with glue or white of eggs.</p>

<p>The great task in cleaning is to remove the repainting
or coats of paint which have been added by restorers.
I have seen this done with extraordinary
skill by the late Mr. <span class="smcap">Merritt</span>, who was recommended
by <span class="smcap">Ruskin</span>, and who was the first and most truly
artistic restorer of his time. I can recall his cleaning
the most beautiful Carpoccio which I ever saw, and a
magnificent Velasquez, both of which had been repainted
again and again, and were in such wretched
condition that even the painter of the latter had been
mistaken. They bore about the same relation when
untouched and afterwards that a dirty old rag has to
a magnificent cashmere shawl. “Caustic, soap-makers’
lye, liquor potassæ, pure alcohol, and the
scraper,” remarks <span class="smcap">Mogford</span>, “are the ordinary means
to take off repaints; all of them dangerous appliances
if not closely watched and used without violence or
carelessness.”</p>

<p>It is advisable to examine carefully the backs of
old pictures for signatures, date, or documents, all of
which are sometimes pasted over with other paper or
canvas. Once, in Florence, I found in a small shop
a portrait of Charles I., but differing in many respects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
from any which I had ever seen. I told the owner
that it was by Vandyke, but he insisted on it that it
was by an Italian with some such name as Guillermo
or Gillonio, till I proposed that we should examine
the back, where we found, after some investigation,
the name of Vandyke. At which discovery the dealer
promptly raised the price of the picture from one
hundred to one thousand francs, and it was, indeed,
cheap enough at that. A lady to whom I narrated
the occurrence said, “Oh, why didn’t you buy the
picture before you told the man who painted it?”
To which I replied, “For the same reason that I did
not steal a valuable ring out of the case in the shop
when his back was turned.” Much is said about the
shrewdness of dealers in antiques, but it has often
happened to me to explain to them that articles in
their possession were worth far more than they imagined;
while, on the other hand, they will, surmising
that a thing <i>may</i> be worth a great deal, charge a
fearful sum for something that is merely <i>cinque cento</i>;
<i>e.g.</i>, a thousand francs for what is really dear at ten.
I mention this in order that the reader may realise
(which few do) what bargains may be picked up by
any one who knows anything of art, and especially
of the humble art of cleaning, mending, or restoring,
which lets us into a world of secrets even in high art,
and which is of more use to a picture-buyer than all
the high-flown æsthetic culture in all the works of all
the rhapsodists of the age.</p>

<p>The preceding remarks on <i>cleaning</i> were drawn
chiefly from the manual by H. <span class="smcap">Mogford</span>, and my
own experiences. I add to them those of M. <span class="smcap">Goupil</span>
on the same subject. The intelligent leader will find
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
no difficulty in collecting and drawing his own inferences
from both:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When the picture is certainly in oil, steam may
be used to remove the varnish. There is, however,
the great risk of loosening the painting from its
ground.”</p>

<p>But when a picture has been, instead of varnished,
<i>glazed</i> with white of egg, we have a coating which,
when old, cannot be dissolved by water or acids; for
this other and specially elaborate detergents, or
cleaners, are employed. There are few substances
which so persistently harden with time as the white
of egg, as does also the yolk when boiled.</p>

<p>Ordinary varnish, when dry and old, can be removed
by mechanically scraping or rubbing with
fine, dry powders, such as that of resin. The dust
from the varnish itself aids in the operation. This
process is slow and tiresome, but it is very often advisable
to begin with it, after washing, as it does not
injure the colours. It is needless to say that it requires
great skill, care, and experience not to “cut
into the colour.”</p>

<p>It may be remarked, as regards this, that in all
cases where there is a difference of opinion between
the French and English artist&mdash;as in the use of water&mdash;we
must remember that both are, or may be, in
the right as regards certain kinds of pictures. So
varied are the methods of painters that it seems to
me to be by far wiser to describe different methods
than to attempt the impossible task of giving infallible
rules.</p>

<p>“Varnish can be removed by means of <i>spirits</i>. To
effect this, lay the picture on a table, and wet a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
portion of it with spirits of wine. After a minute or
more, wash the place with clean water and a sponge.
Thus, little by little, clean the entire surface, taking
care not to injure the paint, When quite dry, apply
new varnish.”</p>

<p>Practised restorers, who can tell by examination
and knowledge of the methods employed by painters
what they can venture on, often use detergents which
would ruin the picture if applied by a person without
experience. These are alkaline salts, such as wood-ashes
or lye, pearl and pot ashes, or salts of tartar,
all of which, except the latter, are extremely hazardous
for a tyro. Salts of tartar may be safely employed
if we begin with a feeble solution, which may
be gradually strengthened.</p>

<p>Wood-ashes, <i>very</i> finely sifted, are spread on the
face of the picture, and delicately, or carefully and
lightly, rubbed with a soft sponge. This must be
carefully washed away as soon as the surface is
cleaned.</p>

<p>Other detergents failing, borax dissolved in water
may be employed. This works slowly but surely;
but, as M. <span class="smcap">Goupil</span> remarks, this <i>lessive</i>, like wood
ashes, must not be left long on the colours, but be
promptly wiped away with a sponge. Lime-water
will serve as well as the solution of borax.</p>

<p>Soaps of different qualities are also used for cleaning,
according to the state of the picture. It may be
here again remarked that no exact rule can be given
regarding an art specially founded on skill and experience.
The beginner should first try his hand on
a few common old pictures.</p>

<p>Soap made into a foam or lather with water will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
generally clean a surface, however dark it may be
from smoke. Let the foam settle completely, and
then wipe it clean with a damp sponge.</p>

<p>Essential oils, especially turpentine, or those of
spikenard, lavender, and rosemary&mdash;of either two
parts of spirits of wine to one of turpentine, &amp;c.&mdash;are
commonly used to clean pictures.</p>

<p>Pictures not varnished require great care and skill
in cleaning. For these <i>yeast</i> with water, or flour
mixed with lime-water, is employed; also spirits of
wine or vinegar. Ammonia is also used. <span class="smcap">Goupil</span>
mentions that one of the most dangerous mediums
for this purpose is the old one of urine, and that it
should never be used.</p>

<p>When the canvas of a picture is very old and rotten,
it may be replaced by a process requiring the utmost
nicety. If only certain portions are injured, it will
suffice to glue pieces of fine canvas on the back.</p>

<p>To completely transfer the painting, gum over its
surface two coats of soft paper. Lay it on the face,
and carefully remove the old canvas ground. This
is effected by wetting every thread till soft, and then
picking it away. A piece of pumice-stone and tweezers
are also used. When all fibres are removed, carefully
glue a canvas and apply it, pressing it well on the
back of the paint. Before it is quite dry, press the
picture with a warm flat-iron, not too hot. Then remove
the paper carefully with a damp sponge and by
tearing.</p>

<p>To transfer a picture on wood, the back is sawn
into many small triangles or squares, which are carefully
chiselled away one by one. Then with files and
scrapers approach the paint till only a thin film of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
wood remains. The last remnant is wetted with a
sponge, and picked or scraped away. First, use
paper on the face and restore as before.</p>

<p>There is a great enemy to pictures in mould or
mildew, which has quasi-equivalents in must, dry-rot,
<i>mucor</i>, or <i>robigo</i>. It is divided by Goupil into apparent
softening and actual softening or mildew. The
former is mildew or mere superficial mould; <i>i.e.</i>, a
light vegetation which gathers on the surface from
germs in the air. It can easily be wiped away, and
is caused by dampness. Sometimes, when long
rooted, it destroys the varnish, which must be replaced.
There is also a mould which is properly decay,
or a radical destruction of fabric, for which there
is, in fact, no cure, save in renewing the canvas and
retouching the picture.</p>

<p>Where a picture is painted by glazing, especially
where varnish comes in instead of body, it is apt to
crack or thread like a cobweb. In time these divisions
will scale off in flakes. Wax dissolved in turpentine
is used for the light cracks. Scaling must
be treated by careful softening with oil and pressing
down a warm iron. The surface must, previous to
ironing, be covered with chalked paper.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that a picture has been painted
over, and I have seen a very distinguished restorer
in such case succeed in removing the outer coat.
This requires great knowledge of the chemical properties
of the paint; also of solvents, and the different
methods of scraping, absorbing, &amp;c. Still, it can be
learned with patience. Extraordinary results have
been thus obtained. It has often happened that men
with little or no knowledge of painting have fancied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
themselves capable of “repairing” very valuable pictures,
and so smeared them over to utter ruin.</p>

<p>Before attempting to retouch an old picture, let the
restorer make a copy of it. If he can do this very
well he is qualified for his work, and not otherwise.
The fraternity of picture-cleaners and menders may
protest against this; but the vast amount&mdash;I may say
the vast proportion, meaning the majority&mdash;of good
pictures spoiled by bad retouching confirms the truth
of my assertion.</p>

<p>It is worth remarking in this connection that very
few amateurs, æsthetes, or “connoisseurs,” so called,
appreciate the value of mere <i>technique</i> or practical
work in art. They “swarm for the ideal,” and that
is all. The great masters were wiser than this. It
would do much good if very generous prizes on a
large scale were to be paid annually for copies of
great pictures. And I would have rewards given
specially for pictures painted with colours prepared
by the artists themselves from chemically pure and
unalterable materials, according to the ancient recipes.
I would like to see a society formed of artists who
would produce such work. It would certainly find
buyers&mdash;in time.</p>

<p>There are to be found in most curiosity shops in
Italy panel pictures of the fourteenth century, earlier
or later, with gold grounds, which can be had of all
prices, from a very few francs upward. They are
without name and of no great artistic merit, but very
curious and interesting indeed as ancient relics painted
“before oil,” and as inspired with the spirit of the
Middle Ages. These generally require restoration.
They were painted on wood of all kinds, very often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
on deal. The surface was covered with a thin coat
of gesso or plaster of Paris, mixed with the white of
egg, and on this the gilding and paint were applied.
The latter was in white of egg and fig-juice, or encaustic&mdash;that
is, wax and white of egg, which is the
most ancient and durable method known; so much
so that long after every oil-painting ever executed
(if left to itself) will have disappeared, the ancient
Egyptian, Roman, or Middle Ages pictures will be as
fresh as if made yesterday.</p>

<p>If a panel be warped or bent, it is straightened by
damping the concave side, and screwing to it crosspieces.
If the ground be scaled away, supply it with
powdered plaster of Paris mixed with gum-water.
The repainting can be executed with water-colours
mixed with white of egg, <i>gouache</i>, or even oil in small
quantities, which should be rather rubbed in or glazed
than painted in body.</p>

<p>A common panel picture of the fourteenth and fifteenth
century, painted with white of egg, can be
well enough restored with water-colour, or <i>gouache</i>,
and then varnished. But the colour with <i>gouache</i>
medium will not <i>hold</i> well, except on the gesso-ground.
It is apt to scale off from any smooth, hard
surface. Therefore it is difficult to restore them by
painting on the old hard glaze. Most of the mediums
which are sold to heighten water-colours&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Winsor
&amp; Newton’s glass medium&mdash;will cause the colour
to adhere.</p>

<p>A <small>GROUND FOR WAX-PAINTING ON POROUS SUBSTANCES</small>
was made as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <tr>
    <td>White wax</td>

    <td class="tdr">40
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></td>
  </tr></table>

<p>Melt the wax in a <i>bain-marie</i>, pass the solution
through a linen strainer, and lay it on in successive
coats on a wall which is first heated by a hand-furnace
or brazier. To close holes in the wall use a
putty made of wax, gum-animé, resin, and whiting.</p>

<p>Colours are prepared for wax-painting by grinding
them with a gluten. They are the same in substance
as those mixed with oil for oil-painting. The gluten
is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

    <td class="tdr">16</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>A harder gluten can be made by substituting copal
for the gum-animé.</p>

<p>There is a vast field for profitable labour in the
cleaning and restoration of old pictures, as well as of
antiques of all kinds, and thousands of young or even
elder artists, whose life is a painful struggle towards
becoming known, would do well to endeavour to raise
the art of restoration to its proper place, instead of
being ashamed to descend to it.</p>

<p>The restorer should make a point of studying <i>varnishes,
oils, and colours</i>, with great care. Let him read
what cyclopædia articles and books he can find on
these subjects, and make all practical inquiries from
manufacturers and dealers. He should, if he intends
to seriously practise the art, study chemistry. I can
imagine no better restorer than a skilful analyst.
There is a great deal yet to be learned regarding colours,
and most of it will come by the way of chemistry.
A great deal is, however, actually being revived
or arriving as new from training “the popular
eye” to hitherto unaccustomed shades, tints, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
tones. During the Middle Ages, when culture was
exhausted in art and decoration, there was a marvellous
development in this respect, even in most delicate
details, though much of it now seems so “loud”
or excessive to us. We have of late years learned a
great deal from China and Japan as regards subdued
colours. It may be that as in Oriental music even
the tenth part of a note becomes as distinct to the
practised ear as a natural one, so these blendings and
subdivisions of hues may be as perceptible to people
as the normal colours. All of this should be carefully
studied by the restorer as well as the painter.</p>

<p>The restoration of a fine work of art which has become
utterly dim, wrinkled with a thousand lines,
and, it may be, utterly ugly to beauty and freshness,
is so much like a resurrection or transfiguration to
new life, youth, and beauty, that poets have not failed
to use it as a simile for all that is expressive of renaissance.
Thus Dean Hole, in his Memoirs, remarks
that, “as when some beautiful picture which has
been concealed and forgotten, removed in time of
battle lest it should be destroyed by the enemy, is
found after many years, and is carefully cleaned and
skilfully restored, and the eye is delighted with the
successive development of colour and of form, and
the life-like countenance, the historical scene, the
sunny landscape, or the moonlit sea come out once
more upon the canvas; so in that great revival of religion
which began in England more than half a century
ago the glorious truths of the Gospel were restored.”
Regarded in itself, the art of restoring
beauty is both beautiful and noble, and deserves to
be regarded as such.

<h2 id="GENERAL_RECIPES">GENERAL RECIPES</h2>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Recipe.</span>&mdash;<i>The word. A formula or prescription
is a</i> recipe, <i>derived from the Latin word</i> recipe,
<i>meaning take. An acknowledgment of money
paid is a</i> receipt<i>, from</i> receptus, <i>or received. A
description of the materials to be used in making
a pie is not a</i> receipt, <i>but a</i> recipe.&mdash;Familiar
Errors.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">To clean Woollen Cloth.</span>&mdash;Rub it with sal-ammoniac
and water till clean, then wash with pure water.
This liquid is very useful, when any article of clothing
has been stained by vinegar, wine, or lemon, to
restore the original colour.</p>

<p>An old-fashioned but excellent method of cleaning
greased silk ribbons or cloth is as follows:&mdash;Lay the
ribbon on a wad or flat surface of cotton wadding,
strew on this dried clay, or calcined magnesia, or
whiting, and over this another layer of wadding.
Pass over it a flat-iron not too warm. The oil or
grease will be absorbed into the cotton. Repeat this
till the cure is effected. If any spots still remain,
paint them with yolk of egg, dry the stuff in a draught
of air, and when quite hardened remove the yoke and
wash with water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wine-stains</span> can be removed by simply <i>pressing</i> on
them pads dampened with cold water. This method
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
will succeed, when wiping only spreads a stain. Salt
alone is also employed.</p>

<p>“When a lady’s skirt of any material has had spilt
on it gravy, wine, oil, or any <i>light liquid</i>, as distinguished
from such substances as paint, pitch, or tar,
do not attempt, as is usually the case, to wipe or
wash it clean. Lay a linen sheet or even spongy
white paper&mdash;wanting this, newspapers may be used&mdash;on
a table; on this spread the soiled fabric very
evenly. Then lay on the upper surface another clean
white sheet, or white muslin cloth, or napkins or
towels, and press on it till as much as possible of the
fluid is sucked out. By changing the white cloths or
paper, and pressing continually, the fabric can be
very nearly cleaned. Then dust it well with calcined
magnesia in powder or whiting. Where these cannot
be had chalk will answer. This will generally absorb
all that remains of the grease.”&mdash;<i>Notes by a Housekeeper
(MS.).</i></p>

<p>“Clean, dry blotting-paper laid on grease-stains is
admirable for extraction. Apply pressure with a flat-iron
or hand-roller such as is used for bread. There
are blotting-paper rollers, made for ink, which are
quite suitable for cleaning cloth; but the paper should
be thrown away the instant it has received any grease;
otherwise it will only spread the stain and make it indelible
by rubbing it into the fibre of the threads. A
good soft sponge will also be found to be almost equal
to it.”&mdash;<i>Notes by a Housekeeper (MS.).</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old woollen or silk garments</span> can be very brilliantly
renewed in the following manner:&mdash;They are
steeped in sulphuric cupreous acid (copper or blue
vitriol), oxide of lead, or bismuth oxide, or simply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
with their metallic oxides, and then exposed to steam,
mingled with sulphuric acid gas. Another method is
to steep the stuffs simply in a solution of sulphuric
acid and copper or of oxide of bismuth. This is
slowly heated, but the heating must be qualified according
to the colour of the stuffs to be revived. The
application of these requires great care and some
knowledge or experience.</p>

<p>Ink for restoring inscriptions on metal of any kind,
silver, zinc, or brass:&mdash;To one part of crystallised
acetic acid, oxide of copper, one of ammonia, and
half a part of soot from fir wood. Mix in a saucer
with ten parts of water. This is said to resist exposure
to the weather very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very valuable aid to the restorer or mender
of implements</span>, when it can be obtained, is <span class="smcap">Raw
Hide</span>. This material dries as hard as any wood and
is tougher than any textile fabric. Thus, if a broken
wheel or any portion of a vehicle is tied with a thong
of raw hide, firmly drawn, when the latter dries,
shrinking a little, it holds better than iron. Raw or
untanned ox-hide or similar skin, when dried, is in
fact similar to parchment, and, like it, resembles horn
in hardness. The strongest trunks in the world are
made in America from raw hide. This material,
when made into small objects, such as flasks, boxes,
sheaths, or portable ink-stands, has often withstood
the wear of generations. As it is cheap, easily
moulded into form, or stamped, it is remarkable that
it is no longer used as it once was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lead-pencil or crayon drawings</span> can be preserved
from rubbing by a light wash of gum of any kind,
diluted varnish, or even milk. The latter is in most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
cases preferable. It is also preservative of handwriting,
and, like all glazes, prevents fading.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bases for beads</span> and similar work can be made as
follows:&mdash;Take mother-of-pearl dust, which can be
bought cheaply at a turner’s, powder or levigate it
finely, mix it with half its bulk of fine white barley-meal,
and make it up with a weak solution of gum-mastic.
Also take snail-shells, or the glaze of any
large, hard sea-shells, washing them first in strong
lye to clean them. Pulverise and make up with yolk
of eggs and alum, or any other fine binder. The
same can be done with rock-crystal or pure flint.
Grind it to finest powder, and make it up with a well-incorporated
mixture of the white of eggs and pure
gum-arabic. This will, when dry, become hard as a
stone, and more and more waterproof with age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To pulverise Glass.</span>&mdash;First put in the fire till red-hot,
then drop it into cold water, after which reduce
it in a mortar. Glass-powder thus made, mixed with
almost any cement, renders it extremely hard. It is
also mixed with paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Burnished steel or iron-work</span> can be preserved
from rusting by rubbing the article with oil of cloves
or oil of lavender; also with a mixture of turpentine,
oil of lavender or cloves, and petroleum. Mercurial
ointment is commonly used for guns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rust</span> can be removed from iron by rubbing it with
oil of tartar (<i>oleum tartari</i>), using a woollen rag.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brass-ware</span>, when it has become dull or rusty, may
be renewed and made to look like gold. Take sal-ammoniac,
grind it in a mortar with saliva; rub this
on the brass; lay it on hot coals to dry it well, and
tub it with a woollen cloth. So says <span class="smcap">Johann Wallberger</span>;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
adding: “With this art a certain man did
once, in Rome, gain much money, inasmuch as he
thereby did clean the brass lamps of the churches and
other things of the same metal.” There is another
preparation for the same purpose still more gold-like.
It consists of sulphur, chalk, and the soot from wood
fires. But as it soon disappears, the brass should be
lackered or varnished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The best cleaner for brass</span> with which I am acquainted
is a German preparation used by <span class="smcap">Barkentin
&amp; Krall</span>, Regent Street, from whom it can also be
obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very strong cement</span>, and one good for luting,
can be made by combining sturgeon’s bladder, dissolved
in spirits, with finest pulverised flint or sand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glue</span>, into which resin has been well infused by
heat, combined with sand or ashes or clay, forms a
strong cement, useful for all kinds of coarse work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very good, strong cement</span> is made as follows:&mdash;To
three-eighths of a pound of water add three-eighths
of a pound of spirits and a quarter of a pound
of starch; also, prepare two ounces of good glue in
water, mixed with two ounces of thick turpentine,
and stir well into the first composition. This is a
very good bookbinders’ glue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The tufa or soft stone</span> which abounds in Italy
and elsewhere is much used when reduced to powder
and burned for building. It is also useful as a
cement. An old writer says it can be brayed in a
mortar, but that “there are many who, for lack of a
mortar, take old baptismal fonts out of the churches,
and in lieu of a pestle use the clapper of a church
bell.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A curious decoration</span> may be made by drawing
figures&mdash;for example, of animals&mdash;with glue or gum
on a wall surface, and then powdering it with cloth-dust
of appropriate colours. These figures can be
stencilled.</p>

<p>As of all repairing and restoring that of <i>human
beauty</i> is the most important, it may be worth while
to give here a few recipes, which have held their own
for centuries:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To make Wrinkles and Freckles disappear.</span>&mdash;This
is more possible than is generally supposed, and
I have known a lady, a great beauty, of whom all my
readers have heard, who at fifty years of age had
artificially and miraculously preserved her face in
perfect smoothness, though I do not know by what
means. The following is given by <span class="smcap">Wallberger</span>:&mdash;“Take
fine, pure alum, compound it carefully with
the fresh white of eggs, and boil it gently in a pipkin,
stirring it constantly with a wooden stick or spoon
till it forms a soft paste. Spread this on the face,
morning and evening, for two or three days, and you
will soon see that it is free from wrinkles and freckles,
and marvellously fair and pleasant to view. Frivolous
souls may carry the sinful misuse of such beauty
to their own account; the virtuous hold in horror all
such deeds” (<i>Zauberbuch</i>, 1760).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lemon-juice</span> or the salts of lemon, or lemon-juice
and salt, are of great service in whitening the hands
and causing freckles to disappear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gum-benzoin dissolved in spirits</span> may be had of
every apothecary. Pour a few drops into a wine-glassful
of warm water, and it will form a milk-white
emulsion, which is a perfect and harmless cosmetic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
for the face, and serves as a delightful soap in washing.
This is the <i>lac virginis</i> so much used two centuries
ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eau de Cologne</span> mixed with water forms a white
emulsion, which is much superior to any soap for
delicate hands. It forms a perfectly harmless cosmetic
for the face. Even a few drops of it in a basin
of water will have a good result. Too much of it, or
of any wash, will have a contrary effect, and dry the
skin. If the mouth be rinsed with this emulsion of
<i>eau de cologne</i> and water, it will purify the breath, and
that for a long time if used as a gargle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A strong marking-ink</span>, or black dye, which will
resist much exposure to the weather, is made as follows:&mdash;Take
gum-arabic 10 lbs., logwood liquor
(specific gravity 1.37) 20 fluid oz., bi-chromate of potash
2½ oz., with water sufficient to dissolve the bi-chromate.
Dissolve the gum in one gallon of water,
strain, add the logwood liquor, mix, and let the mixture
stand for twenty-four hours; then stir in rapidly
the bi-chromate solution, and add a little nitrate of
iron and fustic acid. If too thick, thin with lukewarm
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very hard cement</span> can be made by digesting
fluor spar for some time in sulphuric acid, adding
magnesium sulphate and stirring calcined magnesia
into the mixture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A red cement for iron or stone or luting</span> is
made of red lead and litharge in equal parts mixed
with concentrated glycerine to the consistency of soft
putty. When dry it is water and fire proof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Silico enamel</span> is a thin liquid glaze, finer than varnish,
which is easily applied to all polished metals, as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
well as other substances. It may be obtained in bottles,
price one shilling, with brush, of the Silico
Enamel Company, 97 Hampstead Road, London, N.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Light-coloured gloves</span> may be cleaned by rolling
bread-crumb over them; also with indiarubber. Also
by means of benzine. Several patent washes for this
purpose are now sold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleaning Marble.</span>&mdash;“If ‘Sculptor’ will get some
salts of wormwood, and dissolve in warm water, then
mix with whiting into a moderate paste, and apply
to stone or marble, and let it remain upon either for
twenty-four hours&mdash;and if not successful the first
time, apply again&mdash;he will draw all stains out of
marble, and clear all lichen either from sandstones or
oolitic stones. Thoroughly wash the stone with a
strong soap (say, of Hudson’s No. 2 soap powder)
and lukewarm water, and, when thoroughly dry, give
a coat of sulphuretted oil. He can make his own oil.
Boil in a bath one quart of linseed-oil for one hour,
with half-a-pound of flower of sulphur gently and
continually stirring same; then take off fire and let
cool; then pour oil from sediment, using oil upon
stone. No lichen will hurt his stone if out exposed
to the air, for the rain will wash all clean every time.
I have cleaned several statues with nothing but Hudson’s
No. 2 and water.”&mdash;<i>Work, April 2, 1892.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calcined magnesia</span>, or calcined and powdered
bone, laid for some time on simply oiled or greased
marble, which has first been well washed with soap
and water, will often extract the stain. For ink use
oxalic acid in weak solution with water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gum-dextrine</span>, or gum substitute, is made from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
roasted flour. It forms, mixed with water, a gum
not much inferior to gum-arabic, for which it is, as
the name denotes, a substitute. It is very extensively
used in many manufactures, and may be obtained of
any chemist. It sometimes happens that it is too
brittle after drying, and does not hold. In such case
add four or five drops of glycerine to a teacupful of
the dextrine in solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouth Glue (Mundleim) or Solid Cement.</span>&mdash;This
is sold by stationers in thin, flat sticks or tablets, and
is used by wetting and rubbing it, chiefly for paper.
It is made as follows for labels:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>

<p>The sturgeon’s bladder is first dissolved, the sugar
then added, also a few drops of carbolic acid, which
causes it to set more firmly, and also to resist mould
in dampness, induced by the presence of sugar. This
cement is applicable to glass, wood, or metal. Like
the following, it has the advantage of being always
ready to use, and requires no boiling. If it becomes
too hard to use freely, let so much of it as is required
steep for a time in water. Many think, from merely
dampening it in the mouth when it is hard, and using
it immediately, that it is a very weak adhesive, which
is a mistake. A great deal of that sold by the stationers
is, however, of very inferior quality, and made
with very common glue.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

caseine in silicate of soda; stir into the cement fine
calcined magnesia. By the addition of meerschaum
powder a close imitation of meerschaum in the mass
can be made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turkish cement</span> of the strongest kind, and such as
is used to attach gems to metal, is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sturgeon’s bladder, shredded, is dissolved
with spirits of wine while remaining in a warm place;
the gum is also dissolved in spirit and mixed with the
sturgeon’s bladder; the whole must be then carefully
and slowly boiled to a syrup. Close with a cork, as
it is sure to gum tightly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To improve Corks.</span>&mdash;When bottles contain substances
which adhere to the <i>cork</i> and <i>harden</i>, the latter
should be first steeped in oil or vaseline, or boiled in
a mixture of both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Armenian Cement.</span>&mdash;This is much like Diamond

<p>The sturgeon’s bladder is dissolved in spirits of
wine separately, the gum-ammoniac and mastic also,
but with a minimum of spirit; the two are then combined.</p>

<p>A cement which will resist the action of spirits of
wine will often be very valuable, as when large lids
are to be fastened to jars containing anatomical preparations.
One is made as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <tr>

    <td>Soluble silicate of soda</td>

<p>This must be freely used to make the cover adhere.
When in time it shall become brittle, coat it over with
a thick solution of asphaltum in turpentine or petroleum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To seal bottles</span> very securely, roughen the opening
or mouth with a file or glass-paper, drive in a
hard cork till half-an-inch below the top, and then
seal it with silicate of soda mixed with marble-dust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloride of zinc</span> added to silicate of soda and
oxide of zinc forms a very good cement, which will
resist most influences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bread</span> macerated with glue or gelatine, with a little
glycerine, makes an admirable substance for artificial
flowers, casts, medallions, &amp;c. If worked with gum-arabic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
and a little alum, or dextrine, or common
mucilage, we shall have the same result. It can also
be worked with thin varnish or gutta-percha cement;
also with diluted sulphuric or nitric acids to produce
a hard substance. It may here be observed that
<i>bread</i> is for certain work far superior to flour or starch
paste, since the combination with <i>yeast</i> causes a development
of cellular tissue, the result of which is a
firmer and more wax-like substance. I was led to
observe this at first, not from what I read of the action
of acids on bread, but from observing the bread-flowers
made by the Italian peasantry to adorn images of
saints. I believe that in these there is a little vinegar
mixed. They are quite wax-like. The bread used
should be soft household bread, of course well kneaded
with the acid and colours. Bread-paste would
probably combine well with indiarubber in solution.</p>

<p>Of late, German illustrated newspapers have published
patterns of small ornamental dishes made of
dough or bread, intended to receive conserves of fruit
and other edibles&mdash;the dishes themselves not being
intended to be eaten.</p>

<p>Soft bread with a little varnish or any ordinary
gum and a little glycerine, well worked, makes an admirable
filler for cracks in wood. Combined with
any gum, or even with tragacanth or peach or cherry
gum, and lamp-black (or liquid Indian ink), it forms
a cement which resembles ebony. The more thoroughly
it is macerated the harder it will be. Casts
of panels, &amp;c., made with this are really beautiful.
Rub with oil and the hand after it is quite dry. Add
a few drops of glycerine and alum in solution to prevent
cracking, or, better, a <i>little</i> indiarubber. Soft
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
rye bread hardens to a rather tougher cement than
wheat. Bread cement makes an admirable ground
for gilding or painting. Bread macerated with lime
and white of egg forms a very hard composition like
ivory. Bread, glue, and glycerine, <i>ditto</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horse-Chestnut Paste.</span>&mdash;This is called a cement,
but it is properly a paste like that of flour. Horse-chestnuts
are generally neglected, but they can be
profitably utilised for paste, which admits of the same
combinations as flour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Waste tea-leaves</span> from which the tea has been extracted
can be macerated with gum and treated as
rose-leaves to form artificial ebony. Carefully separate
all the hard portions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gum for general use</span>, like gum-arabic:&mdash;</p>

<p>Stir the lime into the warm solution of sugar and
water. Keep it boiling and stir it often for one hour.
Pour off the liquid from the lees of the lime. This
gum also admits of modifications. One of these is
the well-known <span class="smcap">Syndetikon</span>, which is made as follows:&mdash;To
fifteen parts of the sugar and lime solution
add three of good glue, leaving them to soak for
twenty-four hours; warm gradually, and frequently
stir, till the glue is dissolved. Then let it boil for a
few minutes. This makes a good plain cement,
which serves to unite paper, leather, glass, or porcelain.

paper, &amp;c.

combined with its chloride. The chloride of zinc is
in a heavy, syrupy form, which, combined with the
white oxide, sets very hard. It is chiefly used for
filling teeth, but is also applicable to making medallions
and other objects of art. For this latter purpose
it is mixed with powdered chalk, pulverised glass, &amp;c.

<p><span class="smcap">Cement for Filling.</span>&mdash;Take fresh curd (caseine),
and knead it with water to a putty. It can be used
in this state for many purposes. To greatly harden
it, add one-twentieth of its weight in lime, and more
or less of some indifferent substance, such as chalk,
calcined magnesia, oxide of zinc, and colouring matter.
This sets so hard that it may be used to make
casts or many small works of art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">French Glues.</span>&mdash;Two very excellent glues used in
France are the <i>colle forte de Flandre</i> and that of <i>Givet</i>.
<span class="smcap">Goupil</span> recommends as the best glue, where a very
superior article is required, one made of equal parts
of the two. Break them up, let the pieces remain
fifteen hours in water, then boil for two hours in the
<i>bain-marie</i>, or glue-kettle. After a time the glue will
settle and become clear. Add, if needed, a little
water from the <i>bain-marie</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To give a Satin Gloss to Paper.</span>&mdash;Paint with a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
hypo-sulphite of barium (chemically expressed by
BaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). It may be laid on by itself or mingled with
a colour. It is used sometimes by bookbinders.
This may be applied in water-colour pictures to the
imitation of silk or satin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gomme laque</span>, or shellac, also gelatine glue, is sold
in thin leaves. To prepare it, put into a <i>bain-marie</i>
twenty parts of the gum to one of flowers of sulphur,
stir it well, and add a little lukewarm water. It may
be made into little bars by hand; let them cool, and
warm them when required for use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very good cement</span>, which, according to <span class="smcap">Fred.
Dillaye</span>, is both fire and water proof, is made as follows:&mdash;Take
half-a-pint of milk, as much vinegar,
mix them, and take away the whey. Add the white
of five eggs to the curd, mix the whole well, and add
so much finely sifted quicklime as will form a paste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snail Cement.</span>&mdash;It is said that snails or slugs,
mashed, form a strong and hard glue. This is probable;
also, that it would combine with powdered
quicklime, or carbonate of lime in powder, to set very
hard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To mend marble</span> use shellac in leaves, mixed with

<p><span class="smcap">A cement</span> useful for many purposes, also as a

out the barley, after pressing it. This gives a glutinous
liquid, which, combined with pipeclay and white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
soap, sets hard. It is improved by adding the powder
of calcined bone. Barley water may also be used
in many other combinations. Gum-arabic and thin

<p>The two latter to be dissolved in six parts of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Another for the same</span>:&mdash;Take strong lime-water;
combine it with new cheese. The latter is to be
mixed with two parts of water, so as to form a soft
mass. Pour into this the lime-water, but see that
there is no solid cheese in it. This will form a liquid
which can be used as a cement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cat-gut</span>, which is, however, made from the intestines
of sheep, &amp;c., is of great service in some kinds
of repairing, owing to its strength. It can be made
into very small cord, which will sustain a man.</p>

<p>Very strong cords for fishermen are also said to be
made by taking silkworms just before they spin, cutting
them open, and using the silk, which is then
found in a solid, longish lump, and which can be artificially
drawn out into any shape. It is probable that
the silk in this state could be thinned and applied in
combination with fibre to produce useful results. It
is also probable that this substance, or the silk <i>en
masse</i>, could be used for mending silk fabrics in many
ways. It could be produced very cheaply, because
the greatest expense in manufacturing silk is the reeling,
winding, and spinning the thread.</p>

<p>An incredibly strong and serviceable silk is spun
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
by the <i>elm-worm</i>, which can be raised in any quantities
wherever elm-trees abound. This is much cultivated
in China, and it is said that garments made of
its silk descend from father to son. It is several times
larger than the silkworm, and survives even the severe
winters of Canada. It would be much easier to raise
than the delicate <i>bombyx</i>, or common silkworm. It is
worth noting that a man can carry easily in his pocket
fifty yards of cat-gut or elm worm silk cord strong
enough to sustain his weight, which is very useful
for travellers to know, since it is useful to mend harness
or tether horses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To soften Horn.</span>&mdash;This material can be softened
so as to bend in hot water. It requires long boiling.
According to Geissler, a horn can be moulded to
shape by steeping the horn for two or three days in
half a kilogramme of black alicant, 375 grammes of
newly calcined lime, and 2 litres (two full quarts) of
hot water. Should the mixture assume a reddish
colour it is all right; if not, add more alicant and
lime. After the horn has been moulded, dry it in
well-dried common salt. Horn shavings and filings
are made into a paste, which hardens by being in a
strong solution of potash and slacked lime, in which
it becomes jelly-like and can be moulded. This must
be subjected to pressure to expel the moisture. By
adding a little glycerine its brittleness is much diminished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artificial Bonework.</span>&mdash;Reduce the bone or ivory
to a very fine, flour-like powder, mix it very thoroughly
with the white of eggs, and a very hard and
tough mass will be the result. This can be turned
and highly polished. This is improved in hardness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
and quality by grinding the mass again and subjecting
it to heat and pressure (<i>Die Verarbeitung Hornes,
&amp;c.</i>, von Louis Edgar Andés; Vienna, 1892).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To properly dust Clothes.</span>&mdash;The following extract
on cleaning garments is taken from my forthcoming
work, entitled <i>One Hundred Arts</i>:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“The obvious way to remove dust from a coat&mdash;as
some take evil out of children (<i>vide</i> <span class="smcap">Northcote’s</span>
<i>Fables</i>)&mdash;is by whipping or beating with a stick.
This, indeed, effects the purpose, but it speedily
breaks the fibre of the cloth. Therefore in Germany,
as in Italy, a little <i>bat</i> plaited of split cane or reeds is
employed to exorcise the demon of dust, known as
<i>Pāpākeewis</i> to the Chippeways. But better than this
is a small <i>whisp-broom</i>. Half a century ago this simple
contrivance was only known in the United States
and in Poland.</p>

<p>“Whip the garment with the <i>side</i> of the soft whisp,
and as the dust rises to the surface brush it away.
If the reader will try this on any coat, however clean
it may be, he will be astonished to find how much
dust he will extract or raise.</p>

<p>“All the dust which thus lies hidden in cloth, when it
comes to the surface, acts as <i>grit</i> or powder insensibly
but certainly, and helps to wear away the surface
whenever it is touched. That we take in dust every
time we go out will appear from inspecting a silk hat.
Again, the dust on a coat, &amp;c., every time it is rubbed
by the cleanest hand, takes in grease, which in time
aids in spoiling the surface. In fact, half the wear-out
of all cloth is due to dust alone.</p>

<p>“Therefore, if we <i>carefully</i> dust our clothes with a
whisp, every time we take them off, fold them with
care, and lay them in a drawer, they will last much
longer than they do. Pure air free from dust is as
conducive to the well-being of coats as to that of their
wearers, and Dominie Sampson uttered more truth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
than he imagined when he observed that the atmosphere
of his patron’s dwelling was singularly preservative
of broadcloth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In proof of this it may be observed, that as a sandblast
attacks some substances exclusively, so dust or
grit injures certain fabrics and not others, and that
the latter are all known as the more lasting fabrics.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
